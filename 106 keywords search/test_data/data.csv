293,Web analytics,= Web analytics data sources =The fundamental goal of web analytics is to collect and analyze data related to web traffic and usage patterns.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
294,Web analytics,The data mainly comes from four sources:Direct HTTP request data: directly comes from HTTP request messages (HTTP request headers).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
295,Web analytics,"Network level and server generated data associated with HTTP requests: not part of an HTTP request, but it is required for successful request transmissions - for example, IP address of a requester.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
296,Web analytics,"Application level data sent with HTTP requests: generated and processed by application level programs (such as JavaScript, PHP, and ASP.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
297,Web analytics,"Net), including session and referrals.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
298,Web analytics,These are usually captured by internal logs rather than public web analytics services.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
299,Web analytics,External data: can be combined with on-site data to help augment the website behavior data described above and interpret web usage.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
300,Web analytics,"For example, IP addresses are usually associated with Geographic regions and internet service providers, e-mail open and click-through rates, direct mail campaign data, sales and lead history, or other data types as needed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
301,Web analytics,= Web server log file analysis =Web servers record some of their transactions in a log file.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
302,Web analytics,It was soon realized that these log files could be read by a program to provide data on the popularity of the website.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
303,Web analytics,Thus arose web log analysis software.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
304,Web analytics,"In the early 1990s, website statistics consisted primarily of counting the number of client requests (or hits) made to the web server.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
305,Web analytics,"This was a reasonable method initially, since each website often consisted of a single HTML file.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
306,Web analytics,"However, with the introduction of images in HTML, and websites that spanned multiple HTML files, this count became less useful.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
307,Web analytics,The first true commercial Log Analyzer was released by IPRO in 1994.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
308,Web analytics,Two units of measure were introduced in the mid-1990s to gauge more accurately the amount of human activity on web servers.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
309,Web analytics,These were page views and visits (or sessions).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
310,Web analytics,"A page view was defined as a request made to the web server for a page, as opposed to a graphic, while a visit was defined as a sequence of requests from a uniquely identified client that expired after a certain amount of inactivity, usually 30 minutes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
311,Web analytics,"The page views and visits are still commonly displayed metrics, but are now considered rather rudimentary.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
312,Web analytics,"The emergence of search engine spiders and robots in the late 1990s, along with web proxies and dynamically assigned IP addresses for large companies and ISPs, made it more difficult to identify unique human visitors to a website.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
313,Web analytics,"Log analyzers responded by tracking visits by cookies, and by ignoring requests from known spiders.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
314,Web analytics,The extensive use of web caches also presented a problem for log file analysis.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
315,Web analytics,"If a person revisits a page, the second request will often be retrieved from the browser's cache, and so no request will be received by the web server.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
316,Web analytics,This means that the person's path through the site is lost.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
317,Web analytics,"Caching can be defeated by configuring the web server, but this can result in degraded performance for the visitor and bigger load on the servers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
318,Web analytics,"= Page tagging =Concerns about the accuracy of log file analysis in the presence of caching, and the desire to be able to perform web analytics as an outsourced service, led to the second data collection method, page tagging or 'Web bugs'.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
319,Web analytics,"In the mid-1990s, Web counters were commonly seen — these were images included in a web page that showed the number of times the image had been requested, which was an estimate of the number of visits to that page.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
320,Web analytics,"In the late 1990s, this concept evolved to include a small invisible image instead of a visible one, and, by using JavaScript, to pass along with the image request certain information about the page and the visitor.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
321,Web analytics,"This information can then be processed remotely by a web analytics company, and extensive statistics generated.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
322,Web analytics,"The web analytics service also manages the process of assigning a cookie to the user, which can uniquely identify them during their visit and in subsequent visits.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
323,Web analytics,Cookie acceptance rates vary significantly between websites and may affect the quality of data collected and reported.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
324,Web analytics,Collecting website data using a third-party data collection server (or even an in-house data collection server) requires an additional DNS lookup by the user's computer to determine the IP address of the collection server.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
325,Web analytics,"On occasion, delays in completing a successful or failed DNS lookups may result in data not being collected.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
326,Web analytics,"With the increasing popularity of Ajax-based solutions, an alternative to the use of an invisible image is to implement a call back to the server from the rendered page.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
327,Web analytics,"In this case, when the page is rendered on the web browser, a piece of Ajax code would call back to the server and pass information about the client that can then be aggregated by a web analytics company.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
328,Web analytics,This is in some ways flawed by browser restrictions on the servers which can be contacted with XmlHttpRequest objects.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
329,Web analytics,"Also, this method can lead to slightly lower reported traffic levels, since the visitor may stop the page from loading in mid-response before the Ajax call is made.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
330,Web analytics,= Logfile analysis vs page tagging =Both logfile analysis programs and page tagging solutions are readily available to companies that wish to perform web analytics.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
331,Web analytics,"In some cases, the same web analytics company will offer both approaches.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
332,Web analytics,The question then arises of which method a company should choose.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
333,Web analytics,There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
334,Web analytics,"Advantages of logfile analysis The main advantages of log file analysis over page tagging are as follows:The web server normally already produces log files, so the raw data is already available.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
335,Web analytics,No changes to the website are required.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
336,Web analytics,"The data is on the company's own servers, and is in a standard, rather than a proprietary, format.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
337,Web analytics,"This makes it easy for a company to switch programs later, use several different programs, and analyze historical data with a new program.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
338,Web analytics,"Logfiles contain information on visits from search engine spiders, which generally are excluded from the analytics tools using JavaScript tagging.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
339,Web analytics,(Some search engines might not even execute JavaScript on a page.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
340,Web analytics,") Although these should not be reported as part of the human activity, it is useful information for search engine optimization.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
341,Web analytics,Logfiles require no additional DNS lookups or TCP slow starts.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
342,Web analytics,"Thus there are no external server calls which can slow page load speeds, or result in uncounted page views.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
343,Web analytics,"The web server reliably records every transaction it makes, e.g. serving PDF documents and content generated by scripts, and does not rely on the visitors' browsers cooperating.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
344,Web analytics,"Advantages of page tagging The main advantages of page tagging over log file analysis are as follows:Counting is activated by opening the page (given that the web client runs the tag scripts), not requesting it from the server.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
345,Web analytics,"If a page is cached, it will not be counted by server-based log analysis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
346,Web analytics,Cached pages can account for up to one-third of all page views.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
347,Web analytics,Not counting cached pages seriously skews many site metrics.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
348,Web analytics,It is for this reason server-based log analysis is not considered suitable for analysis of human activity on websites.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
349,Web analytics,"Data is gathered via a component (""tag"") in the page, usually written in JavaScript, though Java or Flash can also be used.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
350,Web analytics,"Ajax can also be used in conjunction with a server-side scripting language (such as PHP) to manipulate and (usually) store it in a database, basically enabling complete control over how the data is represented.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
351,Web analytics,"The script may have access to additional information on the web client or on the user, not sent in the query, such as visitors' screen sizes and the price of the goods they purchased.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
352,Web analytics,"Page tagging can report on events which do not involve a request to the web server, such as interactions within Flash movies, partial form completion, mouse events such as onClick, onMouseOver, onFocus, onBlur etc.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
353,Web analytics,"The page tagging service manages the process of assigning cookies to visitors; with log file analysis, the server has to be configured to do this.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
354,Web analytics,Page tagging is available to companies who do not have access to their own web servers.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
355,Web analytics,"Lately, page tagging has become a standard in web analytics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
356,Web analytics,Economic factors Logfile analysis is almost always performed in-house.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
357,Web analytics,"Page tagging can be performed in-house, but it is more often provided as a third-party service.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
358,Web analytics,The economic difference between these two models can also be a consideration for a company deciding which to purchase.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
359,Web analytics,"Logfile analysis typically involves a one-off software purchase; however, some vendors are introducing maximum annual page views with additional costs to process additional information.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
360,Web analytics,"In addition to commercial offerings, several open-source logfile analysis tools are available free of charge.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
361,Web analytics,"For Logfile analysis data must be stored and archived, which often grows large quickly.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
362,Web analytics,"Although the cost of hardware to do this is minimal, the overhead for an IT department can be considerable.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
363,Web analytics,"For Logfile analysis software need to be maintained, including updates and security patches.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
364,Web analytics,Complex page tagging vendors charge a monthly fee based on volume i.e. number of page views per month collected.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
365,Web analytics,"Which solution is cheaper to implement depends on the amount of technical expertise within the company, the vendor chosen, the amount of activity seen on the websites, the depth and type of information sought, and the number of distinct websites needing statistics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
366,Web analytics,"Regardless of the vendor solution or data collection method employed, the cost of web visitor analysis and interpretation should also be included.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
367,Web analytics,"That is, the cost of turning raw data into actionable information.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
368,Web analytics,"This can be from the use of third party consultants, the hiring of an experienced web analyst, or the training of a suitable in-house person.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
369,Web analytics,A cost-benefit analysis can then be performed.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
370,Web analytics,"For example, what revenue increase or cost savings can be gained by analyzing the web visitor data?",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
371,Web analytics,= Hybrid methods =Some companies produce solutions that collect data through both log-files and page tagging and can analyze both kinds.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
372,Web analytics,"By using a hybrid method, they aim to produce more accurate statistics than either method on its own.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
373,Web analytics,An early hybrid solution was produced in 1998 by Rufus Evison.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
374,Web analytics,"= Geolocation of visitors =With IP geolocation, it is possible to track visitors' locations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
375,Web analytics,"Using IP geolocation database or API, visitors can be geolocated to city, region or country level.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
376,Web analytics,"IP Intelligence, or Internet Protocol (IP) Intelligence, is a technology that maps the Internet and categorizes IP addresses by parameters such as geographic location (country, region, state, city and postcode), connection type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), proxy information, and more.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
377,Web analytics,The first generation of IP Intelligence was referred to as geotargeting or geolocation technology.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
378,Web analytics,"This information is used by businesses for online audience segmentation in applications such online advertising, behavioral targeting, content localization (or website localization), digital rights management, personalization, online fraud detection, localized search, enhanced analytics, global traffic management, and content distribution.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
379,Web analytics,= Click analytics =Click analytics is a special type of web analytics that gives special attention to clicks.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
380,Web analytics,"Commonly, click analytics focuses on on-site analytics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
381,Web analytics,"An editor of a website uses click analytics to determine the performance of his or her particular site, with regards to where the users of the site are clicking.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
382,Web analytics,"Also, click analytics may happen real-time or ""unreal""-time, depending on the type of information sought.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
383,Web analytics,"Typically, front-page editors on high-traffic news media sites will want to monitor their pages in real-time, to optimize the content.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
384,Web analytics,"Editors, designers or other types of stakeholders may analyze clicks on a wider time frame to help them assess performance of writers, design elements or advertisements etc.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
385,Web analytics,Data about clicks may be gathered in at least two ways.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
386,Web analytics,"Ideally, a click is ""logged"" when it occurs, and this method requires some functionality that picks up relevant information when the event occurs.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
387,Web analytics,"Alternatively, one may institute the assumption that a page view is a result of a click, and therefore log a simulated click that led to that page view.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
388,Web analytics,= Customer lifecycle analytics =Customer lifecycle analytics is a visitor-centric approach to measuring that falls under the umbrella of lifecycle marketing.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
389,Web analytics,"Page views, clicks and other events (such as API calls, access to third-party services, etc.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
390,Web analytics,) are all tied to an individual visitor instead of being stored as separate data points.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
391,Web analytics,Customer lifecycle analytics attempts to connect all the data points into a marketing funnel that can offer insights into visitor behavior and website optimization.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
392,Web analytics,= Other methods =Other methods of data collection are sometimes used.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
393,Web analytics,Packet sniffing collects data by sniffing the network traffic passing between the web server and the outside world.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
394,Web analytics,Packet sniffing involves no changes to the web pages or web servers.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
395,Web analytics,Integrating web analytics into the web server software itself is also possible.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
396,Web analytics,Both these methods claim to provide better real-time data than other methods.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
397,Web analytics,On-site web analytics - definitions There are no globally agreed definitions within web analytics as the industry bodies have been trying to agree on definitions that are useful and definitive for some time.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
398,Web analytics,"The main bodies who have had input in this area have been the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau), JICWEBS (The Joint Industry Committee for Web Standards in the UK and Ireland), and The DAA (Digital Analytics Association), formally known as the WAA (Web Analytics Association, US).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
399,Web analytics,"However, many terms are used in consistent ways from one major analytics tool to another, so the following list, based on those conventions, can be a useful starting point:Bounce Rate - The percentage of visits that are single-page visits and without any other interactions (clicks) on that page.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
400,Web analytics,"In other words, a single click in a particular session is called a bounce.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
401,Web analytics,Click path - the chronological sequence of page views within a visit or session.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
402,Web analytics,Hit - A request for a file from the webserver.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
403,Web analytics,Available only in log analysis.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
404,Web analytics,"The number of hits received by a website is frequently cited to assert its popularity, but this number is extremely misleading and dramatically overestimates popularity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
405,Web analytics,"A single web-page typically consists of multiple (often dozens) of discrete files, each of which is counted as a hit as the page is downloaded, so the number of hits is really an arbitrary number more reflective of the complexity of individual pages on the website than the website's actual popularity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
406,Web analytics,The total number of visits or page views provides a more realistic and accurate assessment of popularity.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
407,Web analytics,"Page view - A request for a file, or sometimes an event such as a mouse click, that is defined as a page in the setup of the web analytics tool.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
408,Web analytics,An occurrence of the script being run in page tagging.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
409,Web analytics,"In log analysis, a single page view may generate multiple hits as all the resources required to view the page (images, .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics

411,Web analytics,css files) are also requested from the webserver.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
412,Web analytics,"Visitor / Unique Visitor / Unique User - The uniquely identified client that is generating page views or hits within a defined time period (e.g. day, week or month).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
413,Web analytics,A uniquely identified client is usually a combination of a machine (one's desktop computer at work for example) and a browser (Firefox on that machine).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
414,Web analytics,The identification is usually via a persistent cookie that has been placed on the computer by the site page code.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
415,Web analytics,"An older method, used in log file analysis, is the unique combination of the computer's IP address and the User-Agent (browser) information provided to the web server by the browser.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
416,Web analytics,"It is important to understand that the ""Visitor"" is not the same as the human being sitting at the computer at the time of the visit, since an individual human can use different computers or, on the same computer, can use different browsers, and will be seen as a different visitor in each circumstance.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
417,Web analytics,"Increasingly, but still, somewhat rarely, visitors are uniquely identified by Flash LSO's (Local Shared Object), which are less susceptible to privacy enforcement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
418,Web analytics,"Visit / Session - A visit or session is defined as a series of page requests or, in the case of tags, image requests from the same uniquely identified client.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
419,Web analytics,A unique client is commonly identified by an IP address or a unique ID that is placed in the browser cookie.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
420,Web analytics,A visit is considered ended when no requests have been recorded in some number of elapsed minutes.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
421,Web analytics,"A 30-minute limit (""time out"") is used by many analytics tools but can, in some tools (such as Google Analytics), be changed to another number of minutes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
422,Web analytics,"Analytics data collectors and analysis tools have no reliable way of knowing if a visitor has looked at other sites between page views; a visit is considered one visit as long as the events (page views, clicks, whatever is being recorded) are 30 minutes or less closer together.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
423,Web analytics,Note that a visit can consist of a one-page view or thousands.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
424,Web analytics,A unique visit's session can also be extended if the time between page loads indicates that a visitor has been viewing the pages continuously.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
425,Web analytics,"Active Time / Engagement Time - Average amount of time that visitors spend actually interacting with content on a web page, based on mouse moves, clicks, hovers, and scrolls.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
426,Web analytics,"Unlike Session Duration and Page View Duration / Time on Page, this metric can accurately measure the length of engagement in the final page view, but it is not available in many analytics tools or data collection methods.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics

433,Web analytics,"Exit Rate / % Exit - A statistic applied to an individual page, not a web site.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
434,Web analytics,The percentage of visits seeing a page where that page is the final page viewed in the visit.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
435,Web analytics,First Visit / First Session - (also called 'Absolute Unique Visitor' in some tools) A visit from a uniquely identified client that has theoretically not made any previous visits.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
436,Web analytics,"Since the only way of knowing whether the uniquely identified client has been to the site before is the presence of a persistent cookie or via digital fingerprinting that had been received on a previous visit, the First Visit label is not reliable if the site's cookies have been deleted since their previous visit.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
437,Web analytics,Frequency / Session per Unique - Frequency measures how often visitors come to a website in a given time period.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics

440,Web analytics,"Impression -  The most common definition of ""Impression"" is an instance of an advertisement appearing on a viewed page.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
441,Web analytics,"Note that an advertisement can be displayed on a viewed page below the area actually displayed on the screen, so most measures of impressions do not necessarily mean an advertisement has been view-able.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
442,Web analytics,New Visitor - A visitor that has not made any previous visits.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
443,Web analytics,"This definition creates a certain amount of confusion (see common confusions below), and is sometimes substituted with analysis of first visits.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
444,Web analytics,"Page Time Viewed / Page Visibility Time / Page View Duration - The time a single page (or a blog, Ad Banner...) is on the screen, measured as the calculated difference between the time of the request for that page and the time of the next recorded request.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
445,Web analytics,"If there is no next recorded request, then the viewing time of that instance of that page is not included in reports.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
446,Web analytics,Repeat Visitor - A visitor that has made at least one previous visit.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
447,Web analytics,The period between the last and current visit is called visitor recency and is measured in days.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
448,Web analytics,Return Visitor - A Unique visitor with activity consisting of a visit to a site during a reporting period and where the Unique visitor visited the site prior to the reporting period.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
449,Web analytics,The individual is counted only once during the reporting period.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
450,Web analytics,Session Duration / Visit Duration - Average amount of time that visitors spend on the site each time they visit.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
451,Web analytics,It is calculated as the sum total of the duration of all the sessions divided by the total number of sessions.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
452,Web analytics,This metric can be complicated by the fact that analytics programs can not measure the length of the final page view.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
453,Web analytics,Single Page Visit / Singleton - A visit in which only a single page is viewed (this is not a 'bounce').,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics

460,Web analytics,Common sources of confusion in web analytics = The hotel problem =The hotel problem is generally the first problem encountered by a user of web analytics.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
461,Web analytics,The problem is that the unique visitors for each day in a month do not add up to the same total as the unique visitors for that month.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
462,Web analytics,This appears to an inexperienced user to be a problem in whatever analytics software they are using.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
463,Web analytics,In fact it is a simple property of the metric definitions.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
464,Web analytics,The way to picture the situation is by imagining a hotel.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
465,Web analytics,The hotel has two rooms (Room A and Room B).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
466,Web analytics,"As the table shows, the hotel has two unique users each day over three days.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
467,Web analytics,The sum of the totals with respect to the days is therefore six.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
468,Web analytics,During the period each room has had two unique users.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
469,Web analytics,The sum of the totals with respect to the rooms is therefore four.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
470,Web analytics,Actually only three visitors have been in the hotel over this period.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
471,Web analytics,"The problem is that a person who stays in a room for two nights will get counted twice if you count them once on each day, but is only counted once if you are looking at the total for the period.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
472,Web analytics,"Any software for web analytics will sum these correctly for the chosen time period, thus leading to the problem when a user tries to compare the totals.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
473,Web analytics,"Web analytics methods = Problems with cookies =Historically, vendors of page-tagging analytics solutions have used third-party cookies sent from the vendor's domain instead of the domain of the website being browsed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
474,Web analytics,"Third-party cookies can handle visitors who cross multiple unrelated domains within the company's site, since the cookie is always handled by the vendor's servers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
475,Web analytics,"However, third-party cookies in principle allow tracking an individual user across the sites of different companies, allowing the analytics vendor to collate the user's activity on sites where he provided personal information with his activity on other sites where he thought he was anonymous.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
476,Web analytics,"Although web analytics companies deny doing this, other companies such as companies supplying banner ads have done so.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
477,Web analytics,Privacy concerns about cookies have therefore led a noticeable minority of users to block or delete third-party cookies.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
478,Web analytics,"In 2005, some reports showed that about 28% of Internet users blocked third-party cookies and 22% deleted them at least once a month.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
479,Web analytics,Most vendors of page tagging solutions have now moved to provide at least the option of using first-party cookies (cookies assigned from the client subdomain).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
480,Web analytics,Another problem is cookie deletion.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
481,Web analytics,"When web analytics depend on cookies to identify unique visitors, the statistics are dependent on a persistent cookie to hold a unique visitor ID.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
482,Web analytics,"When users delete cookies, they usually delete both first- and third-party cookies.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
483,Web analytics,"If this is done between interactions with the site, the user will appear as a first-time visitor at their next interaction point.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
484,Web analytics,"Without a persistent and unique visitor id, conversions, click-stream analysis, and other metrics dependent on the activities of a unique visitor over time, cannot be accurate.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
485,Web analytics,Cookies are used because IP addresses are not always unique to users and may be shared by large groups or proxies.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
486,Web analytics,"In some cases, the IP address is combined with the user agent in order to more accurately identify a visitor if cookies are not available.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
487,Web analytics,"However, this only partially solves the problem because often users behind a proxy server have the same user agent.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
488,Web analytics,Other methods of uniquely identifying a user are technically challenging and would limit the trackable audience or would be considered suspicious.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics
489,Web analytics,Cookies are the selected option because they reach the lowest common denominator without using technologies regarded as spyware.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics

629,Learning analytics,"In 1944, Lazarsfeld made the statement of “who talks to whom about what and to what effect"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics
630,Learning analytics,"That statement forms what today is still the area of interest or the target within social network analysis, which tries to understand how people are connected and what insights can be derived as a result of their interactions, a core idea of Learning Analytics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics
631,Learning analytics,Citation analysisAmerican linguist Eugene Garfield was an early pioneer in analytics in science.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics
632,Learning analytics,"In 1955, Garfield led the first attempt to analyse the structure of science regarding how developments in science can be better understood by tracking the associations (citations) between articles (how they reference one another, the importance of the resources that they include, citation frequency, etc).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics
633,Learning analytics,"Through tracking citations, scientists can observe how research is disseminated and validated.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics

1149,Predictive analytics,= Regression techniques =Regression models are the mainstay of predictive analytics.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1150,Predictive analytics,The focus lies on establishing a mathematical equation as a model to represent the interactions between the different variables in consideration.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1151,Predictive analytics,"Depending on the situation, there are a wide variety of models that can be applied while performing predictive analytics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1152,Predictive analytics,Some of them are briefly discussed below.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1153,Predictive analytics,Linear regression model The linear regression model predicts the response variable as a linear function of the parameters with unknown coefficients.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1154,Predictive analytics,These parameters are adjusted so that a measure of fit is optimized.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1155,Predictive analytics,"Much of the effort in model fitting is focused on minimizing the size of the residual, as well as ensuring that it is randomly distributed with respect to the model predictions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1156,Predictive analytics,The goal of regression is to select the parameters of the model so as to minimize the sum of the squared residuals.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1157,Predictive analytics,This is referred to as ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1158,Predictive analytics,Discrete choice models Multiple regression (above) is generally used when the response variable is continuous and has an unbounded range.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1159,Predictive analytics,Often the response variable may not be continuous but rather discrete.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1160,Predictive analytics,"While mathematically it is feasible to apply multiple regression to discrete ordered dependent variables, some of the assumptions behind the theory of multiple linear regression no longer hold, and there are other techniques such as discrete choice models which are better suited for this type of analysis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1161,Predictive analytics,"If the dependent variable is discrete, some of those superior methods are logistic regression, multinomial logit and probit models.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1162,Predictive analytics,Logistic regression and probit models are used when the dependent variable is binary.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1163,Predictive analytics,"Logistic regression In a classification setting, assigning outcome probabilities to observations can be achieved through the use of a logistic model (also called a logic model), which transforms information about the binary dependent variable into an unbounded continuous variable and estimates a regular multivariate model.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1164,Predictive analytics,The Wald and likelihood-ratio test are used to test the statistical significance of each coefficient b in the model (analogous to the t tests used in OLS regression; see above).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics

1167,Predictive analytics,Multinomial logistic regression An extension of the binary logit model to cases where the dependent variable has more than 2 categories is the multinomial logit model.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1168,Predictive analytics,In such cases collapsing the data into two categories might not make good sense or may lead to loss in the richness of the data.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1169,Predictive analytics,"The multinomial logit model is the appropriate technique in these cases, especially when the dependent variable categories are not ordered (for examples colors like red, blue, green).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1170,Predictive analytics,Some authors have extended multinomial regression to include feature selection/importance methods such as random multinomial logit.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1171,Predictive analytics,"Logit versus probit The two regressions tend to behave similarly, except that the logistic distribution tends to be slightly flatter tailed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics

1174,Predictive analytics,"Practical reasons for choosing the probit model over the logistic model could include :There is a strong belief that the underlying distribution is normalThe actual event is not a binary outcome (e.g., bankruptcy status) but a proportion (e.g., proportion of population at different debt levels).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics
1175,Predictive analytics,Time series models Time series models are used for predicting or forecasting the future behavior of variables.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics

2495,Internal model (motor control),"In the subject area of control theory, an internal model is a process that simulates the response of the system in order to estimate the outcome of a system disturbance.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2496,Internal model (motor control),The internal model principle was first articulated in 1976 by B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham as an explicit formulation of the Conant and Ashby good regulator theorem.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2497,Internal model (motor control),"It stands in contrast to classical control, in that the classical feedback loop fails to explicitly model the controlled system (although the classical controller may contain an implicit model).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2498,Internal model (motor control),The  internal model theory of motor control argues that the motor system is controlled by the constant interactions of the “plant” and the “controller”.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2499,Internal model (motor control),"The plant is the body part being controlled, while the internal model itself is considered part of the controller.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2500,Internal model (motor control),"Information from the controller, such as information from the central nervous system (CNS), feedback information, and the efference copy, is sent to the plant which moves accordingly.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2501,Internal model (motor control),Internal models can be controlled through either feed-forward or feedback control.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2502,Internal model (motor control),Feed-forward control computes its input into a system using only the current state and its model of the system.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2503,Internal model (motor control),"It does not use feedback, so it cannot correct for errors in its control.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2504,Internal model (motor control),"In feedback control, some of the output of the system can be fed back into the system’s input, and the system is then able to make adjustments or compensate for errors from its desired output.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2505,Internal model (motor control),Two primary types of internal models have been proposed:  forward models and inverse models.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)

2507,Internal model (motor control),"Forward models In their simplest form, forward models take the input of a motor command to the “plant” and output a predicted position of the body.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2508,Internal model (motor control),"The motor command input to the forward model can be an efference copy, as seen in Figure 1.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2509,Internal model (motor control),"The output from that forward model, the predicted position of the body, is then compared with the actual position of the body.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)

2511,Internal model (motor control),"If the actual and predicted body positions differ, the difference can be fed back as an input into the entire system again so that an adjusted set of motor commands can be formed to create a more accurate movement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2512,Internal model (motor control),Inverse models Inverse models  use the desired and actual position of the body as inputs to estimate the necessary motor commands which would transform the current position into the desired one.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2513,Internal model (motor control),"For example, in an arm reaching task, the desired position (or a trajectory of consecutive positions) of the arm is input into the postulated inverse model, and the inverse model generates the motor commands needed to control the arm and bring it into this desired configuration (Figure 2).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2514,Internal model (motor control),"Inverse internal models are also in close connection with the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM), see also here.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2515,Internal model (motor control),"Combined forward and inverse models Theoretical work has shown that in models of motor control, when inverse models are used in combination with a forward model, the efference copy of the motor command output from the inverse model can be used as an input to a forward model for further predictions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2516,Internal model (motor control),"For example, if, in addition to reaching with the arm, the hand must be controlled to grab an object, an efference copy of the arm motor command can be input into a forward model to estimate the arm's predicted trajectory.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2517,Internal model (motor control),"With this information, the controller can then generate the appropriate motor command telling the hand to grab the object.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2518,Internal model (motor control),"It has been proposed that if they exist, this combination of inverse and forward models would allow the CNS to take a desired action (reach with the arm), accurately control the reach and then accurately control the hand to grip an object.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2519,Internal model (motor control),"Adaptive Control theory With the assumption that new models can be acquired and pre-existing models can be updated, the efference copy is important for the adaptive control of a movement task.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)

2525,Internal model (motor control),The DIVA model of speech production developed by Frank H. Guenther and colleagues uses combined forward and inverse models to produce auditory trajectories with simulated speech articulators.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2526,Internal model (motor control),Two interesting inverse internal models for the control of speech production were developed by Iaroslav Blagouchine & Eric Moreau.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2527,Internal model (motor control),Both models combine the optimum principles and the equilibrium-point hypothesis (motor commands λ are taken as coordinates of the internal space).,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2528,Internal model (motor control),"The input motor command λ is found by minimizing the length of the path traveled in the internal space, either under the acoustical constraint (the first model), or under the both acoustical and mechanical constraints (the second model).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2529,Internal model (motor control),"The acoustical constraint is related to the quality of the produced speech (measured in terms of formants), while the mechanical one is related to the stiffness of the tongue's body.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2530,Internal model (motor control),"The first model, in which the stiffness remains uncontrolled, is in agreement with the standard UCM hypothesis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
2531,Internal model (motor control),"In contrast, the second optimum internal model, in which the stiffness is prescribed, displays the good variability of speech (at least, in the reasonable range of stiffness) and is in agreement with the more recent versions of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_model_(motor_control)
