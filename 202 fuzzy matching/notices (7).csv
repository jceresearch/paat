This programme aims to innovate around the use of smart metering to design, test, manufacture and trial EV chargepoint devices that can perform smart charging in a context beyond the existing smart meter roll out scope. The target contexts for these devices are on-street charging outside the home, and workplace charging. Other contexts will be considered, so long as they are outside the existing smart meter roll out scope which comprises home and microbusiness off-street contexts.  
The programme's aim is to demonstrate that the smart metering system provides a holistic and long-term solution for electric vehicle smart charging, one which can deliver in a range of charging contexts. 

Background
This programme contributes to policy objectives set out in the Government's EV Smart Charging consultation , which outlines the Government's approach and objectives for smart charging of EVs and, seeks evidence on a charging solution. 
The long-term EV smart charging solution needs to meet four policy objectives: grid protection (including cyber security), consumer protection (including interoperability and data privacy), innovation and consumer uptake (of both EVs and smart chargepoints). 
The smart meter system was proposed by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) as the lead option for non-public EV smart charging, based on its established ability to deliver load control in a way which minimises risks to consumers and the wider electricity system. 
Smart metering's current scope extends only to domestic and microbusinesses however, while a long-term solution for smart charging must deliver in a broader range of settings, including public smart charging.  This programme aims to show that smart metering can perform smart charging in a range of contexts outside the current scope. 

Outputs of the programme will include:

Phase 1 Development 
â¢	Design of a charge point which can operate in the relevant contexts (to be chosen by the service provider) and interface with the smart metering system, acting on load control messages sent via this system. 
â¢	Manufacture of the device at test scale (10). 
â¢	Successful testing and issue resolution - demonstration that the device, in simulation conditions, can operate smart EV chargepoints in contexts other than domestic and microbusiness. 

Phase 2 Trial 
â¢	Trial of the device in the chosen relevant context(s) at scale of ~100 devices. 

BEIS is procuring up to 2 projects against this invitation to tender.

The combined value of the ESIF projects is c. 35 700 000 GBP over 3 years, but there is the potential for the value to increase if more ESIF funding is made available. These projects will provide co-investment funding to SMEs, subject to meeting the relevant criteria for that project.

Average fund (grant) size is expected to be c. 5 000 GBP, which suggests over 7 000 successful fund awards to SMEs will be required over the contract period. The Fund Administrator will be responsible for the full SME fund appraisal, award and payment process. They will be required to develop and administer a process that is fully ESIF compliant. In delivering the Internationalisation Funds the service provider will be required to work closely with DIT's regional International Trade Adviser (ITA) delivery partners, who will be responsible for delivering the pipeline of eligible and suitable SME applicants for the projects.

Estimated total contract value range is 2 200 000 GBP to 3 600 000 GBP (excluding TUPE costs and inflation). The upper value includes deployment of additional services subject to increased funding.

Requirements for the Provision of a Third Party Certifier and Quality Assurer of Free Running Explosive Detection Dogs (FREDDs) - Regulated under the UK National Aviation Security Programme (NASP)
      
      Under the National Aviation Security Programme (NASP), the UK has an Explosive Detection Dog (EDD) capability which requires dog and handler teams to be certified and a commitment to regular Quality Assurance (QA) to maintain standards. It is proposed that in future the certification and QA functions should be carried out by a third party accredited by the CAA on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT). Under this arrangement, CAA will maintain oversight of the third party certification/QA provider on a continuous basis and will be responsible for ensuring that the process operates effectively. The overall policy on the use of EDD will continue to be owned by DfT.
      
      There will be additional expert input from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) who currently undertake FREDDs certification and QA on behalf of DfT
      
      The certification and quality assurance activity is moving from a proof of concept stage and into the commercial market where, based on levels of interest already indicated by FREDDs teams, are expected to show considerable growth. There are also the potential benefits of anticipated expansion of regulated EDD provision in the UK to be considered.",,,"Any region","75000000 ",,jo.cottell@caa.co.uk,"Aviation House","Beehive Ring Road",Crawley,"RH6 0YR",UK,+443301382256,,,"https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=501240083 ",,10/07/2020,09/07/2022,12/06/2020,NO,,No,No,No,Services,560000,,12/06/2020,560000,"[Redline Aviation Security Ltd|The National Security Training Centre

Health Education England (HEE - the Commissioner) are putting out this notice as a PIN (Prior Information Notice) with a view to completing a Direct Award. 


Please note the contracting authority intends to direct award the contracts to City University and Kingston University/St. Georges University of London for a short period of time while it determines the authority's commissioning intentions. The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal. 


HEE believe that these universities have the proven academic and technical expertise to support these programmes in 2020/21. To our knowledge they are the only providers of these programmes in London. To test the market HEE had intended to undertake a formal procurement process for these programmes in April 2020 but due to the current national Covid-19 situation this was not appropriate or permissible. 


 


It is envisaged that while the current specifications are underway in 2020/21, an open procurement process will be undertaken for work to be started in 2021 onwards (2-3 years). 


 


The contract period will be a maximum value of Â£300,000.   


 


For the Specification, Contract and the Case for Direct Award please access the portal at:                                https://procontract.due-north.com/Opportunities/Index?p=40bb618e-0a24-e611-8114-000c29c9ba21&v=2 


Project title: Non- Medical Integrated Clinical Academic Careers - Health Education England 


Please access the portal for all documents.   


All communications should be made via the messaging function on the ProContract E-Tendering portal.   


If any provider has concerns with the commissioning intentions outlined within the published documentation, please raise this via the ProContract eTendering Portal in the first instance within 30 days of the date of this Prior Information Notice.

The Council is on track to deliver 1,850 new affordable homes by 2023 with sites for a further potential 2,000 new homes identified. The delivery of these homes involves complex regeneration schemes at Ebury Bridge Estate and Church Street, as well as sensitive infill and prominent high- profile sites across the city. The delivery of these homes will depend on a range of delivery solutions including partnerships with development and investment partners and self-delivery. The Council&apos;s newly formed wholly owned development company also offers a route for funding, delivering and owning new intermediate rent, market rent and sale housing across the borough.

The Ebury Bridge Estate renewal project is the most strategically important of all these developments. Ebury is located in the South-West of the borough, close to the mainline Victoria Station. Railway tracks to Victoria act as a physical barrier to the East of the estate and the Belgravia neighbourhood is to the West. The estate has excellent connectivity and offers a tremendous opportunity for a prestigious, exemplar estate renewal opportunity in Central London.

The Council has made significant investment over recent years developing a high- quality exciting scheme in consultation with local residents and approved the full demolition and re-provision of the estate in July 2018. The Council has established an experienced team and in March 2019 committed to and approved the self-delivery (Council as Employer) of an initial phase comprising two residential blocks providing over 200 new, mixed tenure homes and the first of the new open public squares, setting the design quality and delivery intentions for the new Ebury. This initial phase will enable the Council to fulfil their re-housing commitments locally and achieve vacant possession of later phases. Ebury sits at the heart of the Council&apos;s City for All intention and we are now seeking suitable partners to help us deliver and achieve these aspirations.

The Council is seeking a suitable and appropriately qualified Design & Build partner to deliver the programme which is currently phased, with phase 1 aiming to start on site at the end of 2020. The estimated construction value of the requirement is currently valued between Â£97m-350 m (Phase 1 - all phases). All amounts are subject to indexation and the procurement contracts make provision for changes which mean the procurement value may be increased beyond the range included in this notice, changes will be in accordance with regulation 72 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

In Phase 1 the Council will be the successful Tenderer&apos;s employer and the Council will self-fund the cost of construction. However, the Council reserves its right to amend the structure and funding plans in relation to Phase 2, including but not limited to appointing a third party employer.",,"SW1E 6QP",London,"45000000 ","Westminster City Council",tenders@westminster.gov.uk,"64 Victoria Street",,London,"SW1E 6QP",England,,,,,,26/06/2020,31/03/2026,06/03/2020,NO,,No,No,No,Works,350000000,,26/06/2020,350000000,"[Bouygues UK Limited|London|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,26/06/2020,31/03/2026,"CompetitiveProcedureWithNegotiationOJEU ",

In determining the most appropriate approach, it will be necessary to accommodate:

- FSCS' ambition to exploit the benefits of a cloud-based environment,

- the potential replacement of our FSCS main claims technology platforms as part of our ongoing service transformation,

- FSCS' desire to embrace, where appropriate, new innovative technologies.
 
Potential service providers should note that this procurement is not looking to simply re-let the existing contracts but is looking for a long term 'Strategic Partner' who can support FSCS to fulfil the CIO Strategy for the future.

The scope of the services is split into 3 areas: foundation services, transformation services and future services.

Foundation services:
FSCS requires several services to be in place, or to be available, from the start of the contract. This includes:

- strategic partnership,
- software development lifecycle,
- personnel - time and materials,
- hardware and software,
- microsoft azure and office 365 Support.

Transformation services:
In order to deliver FSCS' strategic vision we recognise there are areas of our technology that require transformation. We expect the transformation to start when the contract starts, and the initial phases to be costed, but for each subsequent phase to be agreed and costed as we move through the transformation. This includes:
- selection, implementation and support of claims platform
- cloud assessment, migration and support.

Future services:

Future services are areas of technology provision that might be moved into this contract over time but would be agreed on a case by case basis. We have laid out the potential scope of these services, so suppliers have an upfront view of what additional services might be available over the life of the contract. This includes but not limited to:

- IT service functions,
- support for finance solutions,
- infrastructure services,
- service desk/ITSM tooling.",,,"United Kingdom,Isle of Man,Channel Islands","72000000 ","Chris Sutherland",Procurement@fscs.org.uk,"10th Floor, Beaufort House","15 St. Botolph Street",LONDON,"EC3A 7QU",England,"0207 375 8194",,,"https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:305297-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML ","There will be an option for FSCS to extend the contract on 2 occasions for a maximum duration of 12 months on each of those occasions, therefore making the effective service term a potential total term of 7 years.
