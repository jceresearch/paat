Our Customers Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Services (CCS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.

Health Education England (HEE), in partnership with NHS England by 2020/21, commit to a significant expansion in access to high-quality mental health care for children and young people, with at least 70,000 additional children and young people each year receiving evidence-based treatment.

As part of the initiatives to support expansion there is a commitment to create a network of support for children and young people, and their educational settings (DHSC 2017). This includes establishing Mental Health Support Teams who will have the responsibility for delivering schools' overarching approach to providing mental health and wellbeing support for children and young people from January 2019. As part of the Mental Health Support Teams a new role called the Education Mental Health Practitioner (EMHP) is being established.

The implementation of the EMHP role will be underpinned by practitioners undertaking an accredited post graduate/graduate certificate programme of education and supervision in clinical practice. On successful completion of the programme, the learner will be equipped with the necessary skills, knowledge and capabilities to work as a qualified EMHP providing early intervention support for children and young people with mild to moderate mental health problems, and signposting to NHS and other appropriate services for further support.

This provision will split over 6 Geographic Lots.

The maximum value of this programme is £15,120,000 inclusive of any applicable VAT over a three year period across all 6 Lots.  The Authority reserves the right to extend the contracts by up to a further two years, to be determined on a Lot basis.

The first year of the programme will be up to £2,520,000 across all 6 Lots (£420,000 each Lot for tuition and supervision).

The funding is set at tuition costs of £11,500, inclusive of any applicable VAT, per learner in respect of the delivery of a postgraduate/graduate certificate completing the programme over a maximum period of 12 months.  The amount of £5,000, inclusive of any applicable VAT, will be available for training each Supervisor, with the expectation that supervisors can support up to two EMHP Trainees (1:2 Supervision trainer ratio). However, this may be adjusted for future cohorts as the training numbers increase.

North London Waste Authority is a statutory authority whose principal responsibility is the disposal of waste collected by the seven north London boroughs of Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest. The Authority predominantly manages its waste arisings through its waste management contract with LondonEnergy Limited (LEL), a private company which is wholly owned by the Authority.  LEL operates an existing Energy from Waste facility at the Edmonton EcoPark which is due to be replaced as part of the Authority's North London Heat and Power Project (NLHPP). 

Under the NLHPP, the Authority will develop a new Energy Recovery Facility at the Edmonton EcoPark pursuant to a Development Consent Order granted to the Authority on 24 February 2017.  The construction of a laydown area and an eastern access to the Edmonton EcoPark are part of the preparatory works for the NLHPP.

The laydown area is to be constructed on an area of open scrubland located to the east of the Edmonton EcoPark.  The laydown area will be used to provide construction parking, temporary accommodation (offices and staff welfare facilities), storage and fabrication areas and associated access and utilities. 

The eastern access works comprise improvement works to Lee Park Way and construction of a new access bridge off Lee Park Way which will provide access to the site for light construction traffic, operational staff and visitors. 

This procurement is for the west side of the laydown area and the eastern access works.",,,London,"44211100 44212400 45000000 ","NLHPP Project Officer",nlhppprocurement@nlwa.gov.uk,"Unit 1b Berol House","25 Ashley Road",LONDON,"N17 9LJ",England,"020 8489 5867",http://northlondonheatandpower.london,,,,15/05/2019,15/05/2020,03/08/2018,NO,,No,No,No,Works,8800000,,22/08/2019,8392436.7,"[BUCKINGHAM GROUP CONTRACTING LIMITED|Silverstone Road

Objectives of the Procurement

The key objectives of the Procurement were to commission the Service for open fetal surgery to treat fetuses with open spina bifida which will provide: diagnosis including fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); open fetal surgery; and adult HDU and ante natal ward care for women carrying a fetus with congenital open spina bifida. This is provided that the woman and her fetus meet the criteria. NHS England sought to appoint two Fetal Surgery Centres (FSC's).

Scope of services

The Service(s) will be required to meet the following needs:
• The population covered is all women carrying a fetus which is suspected of having open spina bifida who meet the access criteria and who are defined as the commissioning responsibility of NHS England.
• Approximately 700 women per year in the UK have an ultrasound scan performed in the first half of pregnancy that results in a diagnosis of the fetus having a major form of open spina bifida (myelomeningocoele or myeloschisis), which is where the spinal column and cord are not properly formed.
• Babies born with this condition are often unable to walk, incontinent of urine and faeces, may develop hydrocephalus due to incomplete closure of the spinal canal and may require a series of operations to drain fluid from the brain later in life (shunt placement). Many women in the UK opt for a termination of pregnancy on the basis of medical grounds, although some choose to continue with the pregnancy. One hundred babies are born in England each calendar year with spina bifida, not all of whom would meet the NHS England access criteria for open fetal surgery. Data from current European Open Fetal Surgery Centres suggests that only 20% of women with an affected fetus choose to undergo open fetal surgery, meaning that these centres might operate on around 10 to 20 women per year from across the UK, including up to 10 from England.",,,"East Midlands,East of England,London,North East,North West,Northern Ireland,Scotland,South East,South West,Wales,West Midlands,Yorkshire and the Humber","85000000 85100000 ","Neli Garbuzanova",neli.garbuzanova@nhs.net,"80 London Rd","Skipton House",London,"SE1 6LH",ENG,,https://www.england.nhs.uk/,,,"Title:Quote/tender 34628 - NHS England Specialised Commissioning - Open Fetal Surgery to treat fetuses with open Spina Bifida.

The Council will seek to award a contract in the form of separate lots. Providers may apply for one or both lots.

The contract will encompass survey design, fieldwork, data provision, managing data access and report writing. 
The Department for Education has an excellent track record of managing high-quality longitudinal studies which have been used effectively to influence policies affecting young people and their families. We plan to build on this success by undertaking additional waves of LSYPE2.
LSYPE2 is currently in its seventh wave and here we invite suitable organisations to express interest in conducting waves 8 and 9.  
Wave 8 will survey only those young people who have been involved in Further Education or are presently in Higher Education (FE or HE) at ages 20/21. Wave 9 will survey the entire cohort at ages 24/25 following a re-contact exercise. A 'keep in touch' strategy will be in place between these waves to help sustain engagement of the whole cohort.  
Complimenting waves 6 and 7, wave 8 will collect a range of data about the decisions that young people make during FE and HE, their experiences of these phases of education, and their preparedness for work. These topics are of key interest to policy makers, as are the economic and wellbeing outcomes of all young people once they have left education, which will be the focus of wave 9. 
As LSYPE2 is an established longitudinal study, it will be important to maintain high standards and consistency with previous waves. The sampling frame for wave 8 will be those participating in wave 7. The fieldwork will begin in March 2020.
For wave 8 (age 20/21), only those who have ever been involved in FE (excluding school sixth form) or those who are currently in HE will be surveyed using web and telephone surveys. For wave 9 (age 24/25), the full cohort will be surveyed using the sequential mixed mode design of earlier waves. 
As there will be a four year gap between waves 8 and 9, it will be important to run an effective, annual 'keep in touch' strategy with the cohort will be used to re-engage participants lost to the study in advance of wave 9. 
As outputs for each wave, we require high quality, timely, cleaned and fully weighted datasets suitable for conducting high quality analysis, and research and technical reports which meet Department standards.

We are located at historic Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex, and the campus occupies a 600-acre estate, which includes a range of academic, residential and recreational facilities. Our primary mission at the BISC is providing study abroad and specialised academic programs for undergraduate and postgraduate students from Canada and around the world. We are also dedicated to making the historic estate, its buildings and grounds, available to the public, to provide interpretation and public education, and to preserve the site's vital heritage.

The catering function forms part of our trading subsidiary, Herstmonceux Castle Enterprises Ltd (HCE), which is responsible for running the gardens and grounds, corporate events and other functions. The primary purpose of the catering provision is to provide a day to day breakfast, lunch and supper provision for circa 150 students in our Fall and Winter terms (1 Sept to 30 April) and 100 in the summer term (1 May to 30 June) in addition to lunch for around 20 staff. The student body is typically between 17 -21 years old and are all resident onsite for between 2 and eight months during their time with us. The majority are Canadian students representing a diverse cultural background typical of the major metropolitan centres in Canada, as well as a significant proportion of international students from China, Japan and the USA. The current student food provision is open dining at fixed times of day, but we are open to considering a hybrid model of open dining and pay-as-you-go options off hours. The commercial catering requirements include our Visitor Tea Room (approximately 23 000 visitors come through the site from March to October) and our conferences and events, which include about 15 weddings and a similar number of special events during the year. We are looking to actively grow our commercial business and make better use of our underused conference and catering infrastructure and are seeking a partner who can assist us in this endeavour.

There are several revenue streams outside the core student provision (which has a budgeted expenditure of 665 000 GBP for the financial year to 30.4.2019).

Chestnuts tea room and the headless drummer/ballroom bar have an annual income of around a 100 000 GBP and 50 000 GBP per annum in turn.

The conference and function area (including weddings) have an annual income of around 125 000 GBP and there are minor ancillary incomes from vending machines in the order of around 6 000 GBP.

We believe there is scope to improve this income and we are looking at a profit share model to assist us increasing the revenues and profits for our Herstmonceux Castle Enterprises business operations.

      The contract will be awarded on a fixed price basis; bidders will be scored solely on their quality response at tender stage. The rationale behind a fixed price tender is to focus the tenderer purely on the quality of service provision. The budget will be approximately £1,175,000 and CPI will be applied on an annual basis. Bids priced in excess of the stated budget will be rejected. 
      
      There is £50,000 available in addition to the annual budget, as a reward for achieving the performance targets agreed at the beginning of the Contract and each year thereafter. We wish to ensure there is a constant focus on delivering quality and to incentivise the appointed contractor to continually seek improvements and efficiency gains in their delivery. We hope this will provide the opportunity to promote and develop a creative and innovative thinking approach from a contractor, with our residents and tenants at the heart of this.",,"GU7 1HR","South East","77314000 ","Patrick Tuite (WAV)",patrick.tuite@waverley.gov.uk,Godalming,Godalming,Surrey,"GU7 1HR","United Kingdom","01483 523149",www.waverley.gov.uk,,,,01/11/2019,31/10/2024,26/02/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1065000,1065000,01/09/2019,1065000,"[Continental Landscapes Ltd|Wychwood House, , Landscape Close, Weston on the Green, Bicester, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, OX25 3SX|NONE||No|No]","Rachel Finn",01/11/2019,31/10/2024,"Restricted ",

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had a requirement to collect evidence from households receiving a measure under ECO to fill existing evidence gaps.
ECO3 is the most focused of the supplier obligation schemes to-date, with funding more narrowly targeted than previously at households who are low-income, vulnerable and at risk of fuel poverty. This focus places an increased need for BEIS to demonstrate which households receive ECO measures. Household demographics are therefore a research priority and feature strongly in the research questions listed below.
As set out in the introduction section, the policy is at a key point in its development cycle. The Clean Growth Strategy has committed to funding domestic energy efficiency until 2028 at least at current ECO levels, however, the current ECO3 scheme is due to expire in 2022.

The Department for Education (Department) wants to encourage schools to improve pupils' knowledge and enjoyment of poetry and engagement in poetry recitation and recall, in particular learning and memorising poetry by heart.

The Department is looking to commission an organisation to support the undertaking of a national poetry recitation competition and develop associated resources.

This will be an initial 9-month contract for the delivery of the 2019/20 competition, with provision to extend for a future two delivery years at the Department's discretion.

The primary aims of a 2019 competition are:

- to encourage and boost student engagement and participation in poetry, which is an important part of the national curriculum. We are extending participation in the competition so that it covers pupils in key stage 2 as well as key stages 3 and 4, to widen pupil participation further.

- to support students' preparation for taking the English literature GCSE and potentially the A level. The Department has not funded a poetry recitation competition since the reformed GCSEs were implemented;

- to provide an opportunity to draw together existing high quality poetry resources from different sources to support schools; and possibly develop appropriate new resources if gaps in the market are identified to support the teaching of poetry, especially at key stage 3. For teachers already focusing on the teaching of poetry, these resources could also potentially have the added benefit of supporting their teaching by reducing their need to acquire and/or produce their own resources; and

The requirements for the assessment of structures on the railway were given in NR/SP/CIV/035: Assessment of Structures (NR, 2004). Network Rail's standard adopted a two stage assessment process comprising of Level 1 and Level 2 assessment. Level 1, the simplest level, and Level 2 typically including advanced methods of structural analysis.  
In 2011 Network Rail developed an assessment technique to support the rapid delivery of an Assessment Programme which covered 13,431 bridge assessments across the network. The new assessment technique is described as a Level 0 assessment. 
The Level 0 assessment is a simplified assessment based on principal checks of critical sections and conservative load distribution. First time assessment of structures using a Level 0 approach is generally based on recorded information and supplementary site investigations as determined by the Asset Engineer.

The TSC is required to develop a thermal hydraulic system code computer model of the UK HPR1000.  
1)	A pragmatic approach to its development should be taken to ensure the model can be applied to a selection of fault transients without expending unnecessary effort developing redundant capabilities that are not required. 
2)	The computer model should utilise a point kinetic approach for the reactor physics for the initial work scope.  However, the model should be developed with a view to coupling with the more sophisticated reactor physics model in the final phase.
3)	The computer model should include a basic consideration of containment response.  A more detailed containment model is not envisaged at this time but there is value in providing the capability and flexibility to develop and couple such a modelling if containment behaviour emerges as an area of regulatory interest.
Develop a Core Physics computer model of the UK HPR1000.  
1)	The TSC will use geometric and isotopic data to derive a set of neutron cross sections for each proposed fuel assembly type as a function of irradiation and other suitable dependencies. Given the proposed fuel loading pattern, this will be used to determine the nominal power distribution for full-power conditions. The nuclear data derived will need to take account of the spectral history of each fuel assembly in the equilibrium core to determine appropriate nuclear data. 
2)	The TSC will use the nuclear data produced in 1) to develop a 3D, transient core model suitable for use as part of a wider model for the purposes of fault transient analysis.  The adequacy of the predicted steady state performance will be confirmed by comparison against core power-distribution data supplied.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,tenders@hse.gov.uk,"Redgrave Court","Merton Road",BOOTLE,L207HS,England,,,"Form of Agreement.docx Call Off Contract - GRS.docx Work Order Specification.docx Warrant No ONR396.docx ",,,01/07/2019,01/03/2021,19/03/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1454832,,28/06/2019,1454832,"[Gesellschaft fur Anlagen-und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) gGmbH|Schwertnergasse 1

The OPG has put in place a contract for the provision of surety bonds, also called security bonds, to cover the performance of guardians of missing persons. 

The aim of the contract is to appoint an insurance broker who will be responsible and accountable for the administration and management of the provision of surety bonds. The broker will be responsible for the procurement exercise to select suitable insurer/ insurers for the provision of surety bonds. 

The Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017 (the Act) was passed to assist families and others to look after the property and financial affairs of a person who is missing. The Act, which comes into force in July 2019, empowers the High Court to appoint a guardian to take control of the property or financial affairs of a missing person. Guardians will be required to act in the best interests of the missing person and to ensure they are carrying out their duties accordingly. 

The High Court will make an order appointing a guardian, which will specify whether a surety bond is required. The court will decide on the value of the surety. The surety bond is a guarantee to pay any financial losses arising from the guardian's improper performance or failure to exercise their functions. 

Guardians will be supervised by the Office of the Public Guardian. The role of the Public Guardian will be similar to his role in the registration and supervision of deputies appointed in respect of persons lacking mental capacity under the Mental Capacity Act 2005.",,,"Any region","66000000 66100000 66500000 66510000 66515410 66517200 66518000 66518100 ","Dashini Ramrous",Dashini.Ramrous1@justice.gov.uk,"Ministry of Justice, 1st Floor, 5 Wellington Place",,Leeds,"LS1 4AP",England,,,,"https://www.justice.gov.uk/ https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice/about/procurement https://ministryofjusticecommercial.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html https://ministryofjusticecommercial.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html https://ministryofjusticecommercial.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html ","

Ensuring UK innovators capitalise on the opportunities presented by the energy system transformation is an essential strand of the ESC's mission. SMEs in particular, face a range of systemic challenges and barriers to get new energy-related products and services to market and ready for wide-scale adoption by customers.  At the same time SMEs must contend with the start-up, growth and scale-up challenges many new businesses struggle with, regardless of sector.  
Our response for supporting innovative SME's is to offer a combined solution.   We offer help to refine propositions and open routes to market through applying ESC assets and capabilities to navigate the energy transformation and systemic barriers to market entry.  In parallel, we combine this offering with tailored business growth assistance through access to a broad network of market, technology, and business domain experts, existing incubators, accelerators and external support initiatives. 
This gives rise to the ISP vision, that aligns with the ESC's 5-year Delivery Plan:  ""To establish the UK's leading 'virtual' energy incubator, supporting innovators to open routes to market whilst helping them to tackle business growth challenges""
We are delivering this vision through a 3-tier platform that can offer SME's a journey through Universal support, Incubation and Acceleration that suits their needs and stage of business:
1.	Universal Support - standardised offerings accessible by all Innovators (not just SMEs), including sign-posting to ESC partner relationships and network 
2.	Incubation - tailored support for selected SMEs utilising ESC capabilities and delivery partner offerings, particularly for those at an early-stage of business growth 
3.	Acceleration - scale-up support for selected potential high-impact SMEs who can benefit from access to ESC capabilities, its partners, and links to investors, particularly for those at a later-stage of business scale-up
This Framework is primarily seeking services for SMEs at Tier 2 Incubation stage and Tier 3 Acceleration stage.",,,"Any region","73000000 79000000 71318000 ","Jim Owen",jim.owen@es.catapult.org.uk,"7th Floor","Cannon House, The Priory Queensway",Birmingham,"B4 6BS","United Kingdom","+44 1212033700",https://es.catapult.org.uk/,,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=72c7766b-ca56-e911-80f3-005056b64545&fromRfxSummary=True&rfxId=0c226219-5355-e911-80f3-005056b64545

- Fullbrook School,

- Kings College,

- Sandfield Primary School,

- Boxgrove Primary School.

The Guildford Education Partnership (GEP Academies) was formed in September 2013 from the Multi Academy Trust set up by George Abbot School and Boxgrove Primary School. On 1.9.2014, both Kings College, Guildford and Sandfield Primary School joined GEP with Fullbrook School. Guildford Grove and Loseley Fields Primary School became a member of the Guildford Education Partnership on 1.11.2016.

The group would be looking at harmonising the cleaning contract across all of the member schools. Four schools will be in the initial contract which will take us to co terminus for all 7 schools. The number of schools within the groups is looking to grow significantly through the life of the contract.

The tender project is seeking to appoint a Supplier whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of service within the 2 secondary schools and two primary schools.

The contract being tendered is for four years in duration from 1.8.2019 to 31.7.2023.

The academic year is based on a calendar of 195 days. Five days are to be used for staff professional development which means that the schools will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days. Periodic cleaning is to be carried out during the holiday periods.

The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all cleaning services within the 4 schools.

Whilst the client prioritises value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the Client is not obliged to accept the lowest price.

The client believes that success should be celebrated and that pupils should enjoy their time at school; if lessons are stimulating and challenging then students will love learning. Much time therefore, is spent reviewing and planning schemes of work to ensure that they are differentiated to meet the needs of all students. As a result, the client is very enthusiastic regarding work experience and apprenticeship proposals and would welcome the input of the successful supplier.

As a group who are continually seeking ways to improve and develop the ethos and environment for students and staff, to give them the facilities they deserve and need to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, any consideration regarding inward capital investment as part of the Supplier's tender submission would be welcomed. The client would wish for the Supplier to look at making this investment for new equipment.

Please be advised that this contract will be let on a 4-year basis.

All academies in the MAT are governed by 1 trust, with clear lines of delegation to local governing bodies in each academy. We have 2 schools in our trust currently, namely, The Magna Carta School in Staines and Bishop David Brown School in Woking.

The tender project is seeking to appoint a supplier whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of service within the existing facilities for the 1 250 students and 139 teaching and support staff at The Magna Carta School, and 615 students and 64 teaching and support staff at Bishop David Brown School, with a focus on exciting new food concepts to satisfy a wide range of pupil tastes and dietary requirements. The Trust would wish the successful supplier to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.

The contract being tendered is for 3 years in duration from 2019 to 2022 and will operate as a guaranteed performance contract, with the successful supplier offering the trust a guaranteed return/cost per annum for the provision of catering services.

"LTE Group",Contract,"The Manchester College",Awarded,2019-08-15T12:58:39Z,"TENDER FOR THE PROVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BRANDING SERVICES FOR LTE GROUP","The purpose of this Tender Arrangement is to secure an arrangement with the LTE Group for Environmental Branding Services, with an experienced Provider to deliver the best possible arrangement in conjunction with exceptional service provision and demonstrable value for the LTE Group.

The Provider will be instrumental in delivering a cost-effective, reliable and flexible large format printing and installation provision with national reach and the capability to deliver quality products and service at pace to achieve LTE Group's stakeholder objectives.

The successful Provider will work reliably, flexibly and in collaboration with LTE Group and its organisations to produce the required signage orders precisely, as specified, within the pre-stipulated timeframes using quality, durable materials as agreed, and with all printing undertaken to an accurate and high-quality standard.
With the successive growth of the organisational structure that is LTE Group, the previous years have seen a steadily increasing demand for a dedicated professional, environmental branding and signage provider to support our in-house team and businesses.

Whilst our group's in-house marketing teams provide the itemised artwork for the development of projects and campaigns, briefs and budgets, the environmental branding provider will have the technical expertise, capability, and organisational integrity to realise the vision to maximise the return on investment.

Below are a few examples of how we will utilise the supplier to fulfil signage orders on an ongoing basis:

•	Graduation event

•	Open Day/Evening events

•	Campus branding

•	External stands for events

•	Awards Dinners

•	Conferences

•	External meetings

•	Staff and student events

This will include provision of short breaks services across the targeted and specialist delivery levels, with the specialist service delivery including a residential short breaks service. The service will support Buckinghamshire County Council and the Clinical Commissioning Group to meet statutory duties in regards to short breaks.
The Provider will be supporting our transformation of short breaks across Buckinghamshire by supporting more disabled children and young people to access universal service provision, targeting resources to those most in need and supporting the commissioners to reduce current reliance on buildings based residential short breaks. There are 3 Local Authority owned buildings that will be leased to the provider to support the delivery of the service, two of which will be specifically for the delivery of residential short breaks.
We are seeking a lead provider model where we would encourage the provider to work with a range of small voluntary organisations/specialist providers to deliver the targeted service and to ensure we can meet one of our key objectives: Increasing Flexibility, Choice and Control through the Targeted Offer.
The provider will develop an assessment tool to support access to universal and the targeted service and develop a robust management of the allocation of the targeted service.
The provider will support the commissioners in the development of personal budgets for short breaks as part of a wider programme to establish Personal Budgets in Buckinghamshire.
The service will also provide a child specific training service for short breaks for both their own provision and other short breaks providers in county.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Ltd, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate Framework Agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Ltd on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself. Any second Framework Agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Ltd may enter into the second Framework Agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

Contract Title: Nicotine Replacement Therapy Framework 
Expressions of Interest start date: 24 December 2018
Tender submissions deadline: 4 February 2019
Initial Contract Duration: 24 months 
Extensions: 12 months + 12 months
Estimated Contract Value (including extensions): £3m - £6m
Description: The purpose of this tender is to set up a non-exclusive flexible local framework with a suitable supplier for the provision of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products to commissioned Smoking Cessation services in Tower Hamlets and other London Boroughs signed up to the NRT Framework.
The framework will be available for use by all London Borough Councils as listed in the contract documents.
The Council is responsible for paying for Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) such as patches, gums and sprays, which are provided as part of smoking cessation services to our residents. NRT greatly increases the probability that a resident will successful quit smoking and is recommended by NICE. 
The cost of suppling NRT is currently re-charged to the Council at the prevailing NHS Digital list price, however following a Market Engagement Event with suppliers of NRT it has been identified that savings could be made by procuring a framework for the supply of NRT by a single contractor. An NRT framework operating across a number of Councils is expected to reduce the cost of NRT products and so make efficiency savings. 
Please note that the Council intends to conduct a reverse auction pricing event as part of this tender process. We will be using Prosolis Ltd (""EASiBuy"") for the reverse auction event.  Tenderers who will participate in the reverse auction are required to sign Supplier Agreement Terms & Conditions
A Bidders Workshop will be held on Tuesday 15th January 2019 and all interested suppliers are encouraged to attend.

The first stage is a Selection Questionnaire which will be used to shortlist suppliers. Shortlisted suppliers will then be Invited to Tender. The Selection Questionnaire document also contains an ITT overview that sets out the high-level requirements of the Framework Contract. This document will allow suppliers to determine if they are interested in this opportunity and consider whether they have the required capability and capacity to deliver the Framework Contract. The Framework Contract will be a sole supplier and single lot solution. Those suppliers shortlisted from Selection Questionnaire and Invited to Tender will be evaluated in accordance with the Award Criteria contained within the Invitation to Tender documents.

The Leisure Centre, which will replace the existing Waterfront Leisure Centre, will be delivered by the Council, whereas current plans for the residential element are to be developed in outline for the planning submission, and then either sold or delivered with a development partner once planning has been received. A hybrid planning application is therefore proposed with the Leisure Centre element being a detailed application and the residential in outline. 
This development represents a significant investment by the Council in a key location, and as such the Council has high aspirations, and has set the following priorities for the project:
The scheme is to provide a meaningful mixed-use development that creates a high quality of public realm, with an important objective to contribute to regeneration in Woolwich Town Centre. It will: 
•	Act as a flagship building for the redevelopment of Woolwich Town Centre and make it a new destination to visit and enjoy
•	Be a safe, welcoming, and meaningful public space at ground floor level should anchor the new development and provide valuable public amenity. Public spaces are to be designed to take advantage, where possible, of direct sun-light, and be overlooked for passive monitoring. Blank facades at ground level are to be avoided
•	Complement existing routes around the site, and where possible improve access and connection.
•	Have clear and legible entrances to all buildings from the public realm.
•	Provide additional opportunities for the residents of the borough to be more active and, over time, reduce the numbers of children and adults who are currently overweight and obese 
•	Improve the local evening and leisure offer, boosting the local economy and employing local residents 
•	Provide state of the art/ modern facilities with swimming, sport and physical activity opportunities with fixed gym equipment and a range of other physical activity experiences, along with a Sky Bar and café 
•	Involves the relocation of the Waterfront Leisure Centre to the site, but otherwise does not deal with the Waterfront site
•	Be a significant family destination, with the pool being a large leisure water facility
•	Include retail, leisure, and possible office provision 
•	Include a reasonable level of new homes should be provided on the site, in keeping with the highest PTAL levels, to help meet the Council's housing targets and support the viability of the development",,,London,"71200000 ","Pius Appiah",Pius.Appiah@royalgreenwich.gov.uk,"3rd Floor, The Woolwich Centre","35 Wellington Street, Woolwich",London,"SE18 6HQ",England,"+44 2089213099",http://www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/,,,,10/06/2019,09/06/2020,22/03/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,500000,,03/06/2019,813522,"[Gleeds Advisory|95 New Cavendish Street, London, Greater London, W1W 6XF, United Kingdom|NONE||No|No]",,10/06/2019,09/06/2020,"Other ",
