These are children who are not receiving support currently from statutory agencies; and are at risk of harm and/or experiencing adverse impact to their health and wellbeing due to Covid-19.

The contract will focus on supporting children experiencing or at risk of hidden harm. These are vulnerable children who do not meet the threshold for statutory services and do not have an education, health and care plan or child in need or child protection plan and who are not looked after. These children and young people are being adversely impacted by lockdown.

The purpose of the contract is to prevent their needs escalating so that they do not require more significant interventions either now or at a later date. The group of children that will be identified include those who have experienced or are at risk of serious crimes, young people with disabilities and SEND, children in families experiencing domestic abuse and young couples perpetrating domestic abuse, children experiencing mental health difficulties, trafficked children and homeless families and young people.

As a result of Covid-19 measures, there is a specific need to provide additional services to children who either are, or at risk of, experiencing harm because many of the usual mechanisms for identifying risks have been removed or are experiencing other pressures, for example health visitors, police, community hubs, GPs and schools.

In this instance the events that have led to the extreme urgency are the lockdown which has been a key measure in trying to contain Covid-19 and in conjunction with that the closure of schools, to all but a specified minority of children. Whilst that minority has included 'vulnerable children' (as defined in the DfE Guidance: Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak - actions for educational providers and other partners, updated 15 Mai 2020) not all such children have been in attendance and some children who would not have met the definition of 'vulnerable' at the commencement of the lockdown will have become 'vulnerable' during the lockdown period.",,,"Any region","85300000 ",,beth.lord@education.gov.uk,"St. Paul&apos;s Place",,Sheffield,"S1 2JF",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,31/05/2020,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,7265000,,01/06/2020,7265000,"[Barnardo's|Tanners House, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1QG|NONE_OTHER||No|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,11:59

The ESN will deliver integrated critical voice and broadband data services to all three emergency services (3ES) and other users throughout GB (England, Wales and Scotland). These services require a mobile communications network capable of providing the full coverage, resilience, security and public safety functionality required by the 3ES. The ESN will replace those services delivered under current service contract(s). A number of these service contracts operate across the 3ES and other users. The new service contracts were awarded during 2015 to facilitate commencement of service delivery from late 2016 as existing service contracts begin to expire. The procurement is divided into 3 Lots with associated Related Projects. \r
\r
This Contract Award Notice is with regard to a Contract awarded to one of the incumbent Suppliers of Control Room systems (as deployed to the UK 3ES customers) to develop a compatible ICCS product upgrade that enables the Supplier's control room ICCS product(s) to interface to ESN. The development is to commence with integration for the minimum subset of Kodiak 9.0, 9.1 and Kodiak 10 features as set out in the Technical Requirements, with a view to subsequently migrating to Kodiak 11 and potentially other future releases as necessary to support the delivery of ESN. \r
\r
The Contract includes the provision of software development services, a proof of concept and testing at a Live End User site, as well as the potential for the provision of ongoing support and maintenance in support of the Supplier's ESN capability. \r

This will involve working with others to understand the increases in costs and where scope may have expanded. It is assumed that initial value management workshops arranged by will take place in the first half of June in order to identify potential cost levers for further investigation (e.g. scope, time, inflation etc.). Once the consultants have identified these levers, further optioneering exercises with the users will take place in July and August. 
Benefits and Requirements. This will provide stakeholders with visual clarity of the impact of their decisions on changes to scope/requirements on the benefits used to underpin HMT's investment decision. The basis of this can be done using existing data and knowledge from the SCAH Programme Team on the benefits approach to date, but will need to be validated and agreed with by senior users. We have assumed that two one-hour sessions will be required to do this. Deliverables include: a digital map of benefits on the right hand side, logic links to outcomes and requirements on the left hand side and % contribution of outcomes to benefits; and a report to summaries the findings, recommended quick wins and logical next steps and what these next steps will achieve for the SCAH Programme.

\r
As part of the National Testing Strategy, Pillar 4's surveillance work endeavours to capture a nationwide picture of Covid-19's prevalence amongst the wider UK population.\r
Unlike the other demographic specific studies, the UK Biobank Seroprevalence Study is intended to capture [sero]prevalence data from across the country, both now and over the course of the next 6 months. The data from the study will be sent to DHSC on a weekly basis.\r
DHSC have partnered with the UK Biobank who are project managing the research, given their existing cohort of participants, operational and analytical expertise.\r
UK Biobank aims to collect monthly blood samples and symptom data (via a short questionnaire) from its participants (as well as from their children and grandchildren aged over 18) to enable an assessment of the extent of previous infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus (by measuring blood antibodies) in different locations and age groups across the UK.\r
The aim is to recruit a population-based sub-study from UK Biobank participants and their adult (i.e. aged over 18) children and grandchildren. It is expected that participants will contribute to the study for 6 months (extendable). The duration of the study will be determined by the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.\r
The objective of the study is to determine the extent of previous infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID‐19 (by collecting samples that can be measured for blood antibodies) in a nationally representative sample of the UK population.\r
The UK Biobank funded activities cover participant recruitment, sample collection, sample processing and storage, and provision of samples to the University of Oxford for sample assay to measure blood antibodies and reporting of infection rates based on returned quantitative assay data.\r

      Under the National Aviation Security Programme (NASP), the UK has an Explosive Detection Dog (EDD) capability which requires dog and handler teams to be certified and a commitment to regular Quality Assurance (QA) to maintain standards. It is proposed that in future the certification and QA functions should be carried out by a third party accredited by the CAA on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT). Under this arrangement, CAA will maintain oversight of the third party certification/QA provider on a continuous basis and will be responsible for ensuring that the process operates effectively. The overall policy on the use of EDD will continue to be owned by DfT.
      
      There will be additional expert input from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) who currently undertake FREDDs certification and QA on behalf of DfT
      
      The certification and quality assurance activity is moving from a proof of concept stage and into the commercial market where, based on levels of interest already indicated by FREDDs teams, are expected to show considerable growth. There are also the potential benefits of anticipated expansion of regulated EDD provision in the UK to be considered.",,,"Any region","73000000 79710000 73100000 72225000 75222000 24600000 73431000 75000000 73400000 38546000 35000000 ",,jo.cottell@caa.co.uk,"Aviation House","Beehive Ring Road",Crawley,"RH6 0YR",UK,+443301382256,,,"https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=501273942 ",,10/07/2020,09/07/2022,01/06/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,560000,,01/06/2020,560000,"[Redline Aviation Security Ltd|The National Security Training Centre

The existing bridge is narrow and has a western entrance that is 'hidden' within an existing building, so that only those with local knowledge know of the bridge's presence. A new bridge structure will also act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the Bedford Wharf site. This pedestrian and cycle bridge forms a vital link between the Railway Station and the Town Centre. 
      The bridge forms a key component of the Guildford Town Centre Transport Package, with the remaining funding workstream from the M3 LEP secured in March 2016. 
      
      The Council invites applications from suitably qualified operators and supply chains to build the Council's design for the bridge.
      
      In compliance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Council has published full details of its selection questionnaire (SQ) and ultimate documentation concerning tenders to be returned. For the avoidance of doubt only the SQ/ PAS 91 return is required in the first instance and the deadline for the return of this document is the 22nd March 2019 at 12 Noon.

New digital behaviours, particularly for younger audiences, means that it is becoming increasingly challenging to reach young audiences solely through promotion on our owned media channels. Thus, it is essential, in order to fulfil our responsibilities, that we use paid for media channels to complement our owned media.

The BBC has therefore procured a media agency to manage the planning, buying and return on investment evaluation of external media activity, as well as delivering strategic insights and analysis of the wider emerging media market. This is critical to ensure we deliver value for money to the UK public.

The maximum contract duration is up to 4 years, with the annual contract value incorporating both the paid media budget and agency fees estimated at GBP 25 m p.a.

For the BBC to meet its public service obligations, it is essential that all audiences are aware of the programmes and services that we create. To ensure that we reach all audiences effectively, particularly younger audiences who are spending less time on our owned platforms, we need to use paid for media alongside our owned media. Investing in paid media ensures we are able to engage critical audiences with the right reach and frequency to create awareness of the programmes and services they have paid for through their licence fee.",,,"Any region","79341400 ",,hannah.stevenson@bbc.co.uk,"Broadcasting House, Portland Place",,London,"W1A 1AA",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/05/2024,06/09/2019,YES,tender_213470/790560,Yes,No,No,Services,100000000,,01/06/2020,100000000,"[Havas Media Ltd|London, UK|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,01/06/2020,31/05/2024,"CompetitiveProcedureWithNegotiationOJEU ",

The COVID-19 outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as declared by the World Health Organisation on 30 Jan 2020.  The WHO Director General characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 Mar 2020.

A key element of ensuring an effective response to the pandemic is ensuring that there are sufficient NHS key workers available to deliver frontline NHS services. Public Health England guidance (based on expert medical opinion) states that if an individual has COVID-19 they must self-isolate for seven days; or if a member of their household has COVID-19 they must self-isolate for fourteen days.

In practice, these rules mean that on a day-to-day basis, many frontline staff, including in the NHS and carers, are unable to work due to needing to self-isolate - despite the possibility that they are not infected with COVID-19.

This is why on 27 March 2020, the Government announced major plans to rapidly expand the volume of COVID-19 testing available for NHS and other Key Workers outside of the NHS system - with the aim of getting as many non-infected staff back to work as soon as they are able. A key element of these plans is testing of Key Workers in the first instance before rolling out more widely. This represents Pillar 2 of the Testing Strategy communicated and implemented by the Government.

COVID-19 is serious and its consequences pose a risk to life.  Cabinet Office published PPN 01/20: Responding to COVID-19 on procuring with extreme urgency which states that contracting authorities may enter into contracts without
competing or advertising the requirement where certain tests are met, as follows:

1) There are genuine reasons for extreme urgency as there is a significant public health risk requiring immediate action as a result of COVID-19.
2) The COVID-19 outbreak and its consequences are unprecedented and the Contracting Authority could not have reasonably foreseen either of these.

The CMS platform will need to have the functionality required to support the new website.

The new website will deliver:

• a modern website design that is optimised for mobile devices, meets all accessibility and security standards and uses appropriate design features to maximise customer engagement;

•	There are genuine reasons for extreme urgency - the response to the COVID-19 consequences needs to be immediate because of public health risks.
•	The events that have led to the need for extreme urgency were unforeseen - the COVID-19 situation is so novel that the consequences are not something that MDC could have predicted.
•	It is impossible to comply with the usual timescales in the Public Contract Regulations (2015) - there is no time to run an accelerated procurement under the open or restricted procedures or competitive procedures with negotiation, nor does the MDC have access to an existing commercial agreement such as a framework or dynamic purchasing system.

The COVID-19 outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as declared by the World Health Organisation on 30 Jan 2020.  The WHO Director General characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 Mar 2020.

A key element of ensuring an effective response to the pandemic is ensuring that there are sufficient NHS key workers available to deliver frontline NHS services. Public Health England guidance (based on expert medical opinion) states that if an individual has COVID-19 they must self-isolate for seven days; or if a member of their household has COVID-19 they must self-isolate for fourteen days.

In practice, these rules mean that on a day-to-day basis, many frontline staff, including in the NHS and carers, are unable to work due to needing to self-isolate - despite the possibility that they are not infected with COVID-19.

This is why on 27 March 2020, the Government announced major plans to rapidly expand the volume of COVID-19 testing available for NHS and other Key Workers outside of the NHS system - with the aim of getting as many non-infected staff back to work as soon as they are able. A key element of these plans is testing of Key Workers in the first instance before rolling out more widely. This represents Pillar 2 of the Testing Strategy communicated and implemented by the Government.

COVID-19 is serious and its consequences pose a risk to life.  Cabinet Office published PPN 01/20: Responding to COVID-19 on procuring with extreme urgency which states that contracting authorities may enter into contracts without
competing or advertising the requirement where certain tests are met, as follows:

1) There are genuine reasons for extreme urgency as there is a significant public health risk requiring immediate action as a result of COVID-19.
2) The COVID-19 outbreak and its consequences are unprecedented and the Contracting Authority could not have reasonably foreseen either of these. 
3) It is not possible to comply with the timescales of another procedure due to the urgent requirement to obtain the testing kits and associated services being contracted for. It is imperative that testing is quickly and securely mobilised and for the service to be provided on a nationwide scale for Key Workers rapidly. 
4) The COVID 19 pandemic and its consequences are not attributable to the Contracting Authority.",,,"Any region","33140000 ",,procurement.operations@dhsc.gov.uk,"Department of Health, 39 Victoria Street",,London,"SW1H 0EU",England,,,,,"

The COVID-19 outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as declared by the World Health Organisation on 30 Jan 2020.  The WHO Director General characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 Mar 2020.

A key element of ensuring an effective response to the pandemic is ensuring that there are sufficient NHS key workers available to deliver frontline NHS services. Public Health England guidance (based on expert medical opinion) states that if an individual has COVID-19 they must self-isolate for seven days; or if a member of their household has COVID-19 they must self-isolate for fourteen days. 
In practice, these rules means that on a day-to-day basis, many frontline staff, including in the NHS and carers, are unable to work due to needing to self-isolate - despite the possibility that they are not infected with COVID-19. 
This is why on 27 March the Government announced major plans to rapidly expand the volume of COVID-19 testing available for NHS and other Key Workers outside of the NHS system - with the aim of getting as many non-infected staff back to work as soon as they are able. A key element of these plans is testing of Key Workers in the first instance before rolling out more widely.

The usual alternative route planned for in the event of difficulty using the Airbridge, is through Chile, which is not viable as the country has closed its borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a call for competition in accordance with Article 32 of Directive 2014/24/EU:

Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive

The COVID-19 emergency has hugely disrupted the planned arrangements to return personnel from FalklandIslands to the UK in a manner that was not foreseeable, and there is an immediate need to secure safe boardand passage for the staff.
Staff working in the Antarctic region who would normally return to the UK via the Falkland Islands, would usuallymake use of the MoD Air Bridge to return to the UK. MoD advise the Airbridge is now prioritised for medical andother emergency staff and in addition its normal routing is compromised.
The usual alternative route planned for in the event of difficulty using the Airbridge, is through Chile, which is notviable as the country has closed its borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
No other safe, reliable alternative arrangements (e.g. commercial aircraft) are available. It is neither practical norsafe for staff to remain in the Falkland Islands for any extended period. Charter of a ship is the best solution and the MS Hebridean Sky is the only suitable vessel in the vicinity, that is immediately available. Accordingly theextreme urgency exemption permitted under Regulation 32 (2) (c) applies.
This Direct Award complies with the provisions of PPN 0120, which require that Regulation 32(2) (c) may beinvoked in response to the current COVID-19 outbreak, so long as the following tests have all been met:
1. There are genuine reasons for the extreme urgency;
2. The events that have led to the need for extreme urgency were unforeseeable;
3. It is impossible to comply with the usual timescales for PCR;
4. The situation is not attributable to the contracting authority.
All of these tests are satisfied in the current circumstances.

The time has come for the University to invest in a suitable and robust PGR system that:

* Actively manages the progression of Doctoral Researchers in order to ensure that we meet the completion standards expected by the University, Research Council United Kingdom (RCUK), HEFCE and others. 

*Records (and archives) the progression of PGRs in order to be compliant with our own QME requirements as well as external requirements and potential audits by RCUK in respect of grant income and HEFCE in respect of RDP income. 

* Provides the necessary Management Information for the Doctoral College, Directors of Faculty Graduate Schools, and Directors of Centres of Doctoral programmes.

The Universities current version of PGR Tracker is not supportable over the medium term. Rather than trying to fix the underlying issues with the current version, it is a better use of resource to move to a replacement.

The Contracts require an Initial Inspection around 5 years from contract expiry and a second inspection around 18 months from contract expiry. The first inspection would require the inspection on site of in excess of 45,000 individual assets within a six-month window. The second inspection would require the inspection of in excess of 250,000 individual assets within a three-	month window. This is undeliverable in terms of the network occupancy that would be required and the technical resource to undertake the inspections.
The DBFO Contract Completion Programme team have developed a more efficient Handback process that provides a Residual Life definition for each asset type and a process that makes use of existing asset inspection data to take a risk-based approach to the assessment of the Handback requirements. This is aimed at reducing the number of inspections to less than 10% of that previously required. Other benefits are the significant reduction in network occupancy requirements during RIS2 and the health & safety benefits of not carrying out onsite inspections.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation.

The Framework agreement allows potentially all Local Education Authority (LEA) schools to join. 

Thomas Tallis School is acting a central purchasing body conducting the procurement on behalf of itself and these other schools. The schools listed in the pricing documentation are intending to award call-off contracts on the establishment of the framework. 

The process will award two separate single-supplier framework agreements, one for primary & nursery schools and the other for secondary schools needs.

The Contracting Authority for this OJEU Restricted Procedure will initially be Thomas Tallis School, who are a member of the Greenwich Community Schools Partnership (GCSP).  The GCSP are setting up a Community Interest Company (CIC) yet to be named which we expect to be established and in place to award the frameworks at the end of this process.  The Contracting Authority also reserves the right to award the frameworks and then to novate them to the CIC via a deed of novation.

The proposed value of the new contract is £1,579,167
for the full period.
Procurements were initiated for varying MAS models in Brighton & Hove CCG in 2017 and 2019. However, these did not meet their intended objectives and consequently were not awarded.
Given the unsuccessful recent procurement, and the need to ensure continuity of Patient care beyond March 31st 2020, the CCG seeks to award a contract to HERE for a service that provides the functions already delivered within the current provision: assessment, diagnosis, medication management and review for those diagnosed by the service and one year of post diagnostic support.
This Direct Award to the incumbent provider is in the best interests of patients and vulnerable local people as it will minimise disruption to patients whilst still meeting identified patient needs, maintaining service safety and quality and minimising commissioner and provider risk.
This direct award proposal will also provide additional time for the CCGs to develop and embed a more joined up strategy for dementia services across Sussex Health and Care Partnership, and embark on a formal procurement process preparatory to an award for new services from April 2023. Implementation of the NHS
Long Term Plan also creates the potential for a more diverse provider market, which may increase the success of future procurements.
For further details of the full rationale leading to this proposal, the PIN is available to view through the Intend e-tendering portal https://in-tendhost.co.uk/soepscommissioning, reference: Memory Assessment Service Brighton and Hove CCG (NHS/SOEPS/20.634 PINCC) until 23:59 on Wednesday 18th March 2020. A contract will be awarded without further publication.
Should you wish to discuss the content of this PIN further please raise this as a project message via the correspondence area of the Intend e-Tendering Portal in the first instance, by the deadline of 23:59 on Wednesday 18th March 2020.",,,"South East","85100000 ",,aelliott1@nhs.net,"36-38 Friars Walk",,Lewes,"BN7 2PB",England,,,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/soepscommissioning/aspx/Home ","The Services to which this notice relates fall within Chapter 3, Section 7, Particular Procurement Regimes to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and Part H of the Annex V to the Public Contracts Directive (also known as""light touch regime"" formerly Part B services).
