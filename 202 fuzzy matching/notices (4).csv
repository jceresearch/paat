These are children who are not receiving support currently from statutory agencies; and are at risk of harm and/or experiencing adverse impact to their health and wellbeing due to Covid-19.

The contract will focus on supporting children experiencing or at risk of hidden harm. These are vulnerable children who do not meet the threshold for statutory services and do not have an education, health and care plan or child in need or child protection plan and who are not looked after. These children and young people are being adversely impacted by lockdown.

The purpose of the contract is to prevent their needs escalating so that they do not require more significant interventions either now or at a later date. The group of children that will be identified include those who have experienced or are at risk of serious crimes, young people with disabilities and SEND, children in families experiencing domestic abuse and young couples perpetrating domestic abuse, children experiencing mental health difficulties, trafficked children and homeless families and young people.

As a result of Covid-19 measures, there is a specific need to provide additional services to children who either are, or at risk of, experiencing harm because many of the usual mechanisms for identifying risks have been removed or are experiencing other pressures, for example health visitors, police, community hubs, GPs and schools.

In this instance the events that have led to the extreme urgency are the lockdown which has been a key measure in trying to contain Covid-19 and in conjunction with that the closure of schools, to all but a specified minority of children. Whilst that minority has included 'vulnerable children' (as defined in the DfE Guidance: Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak - actions for educational providers and other partners, updated 15 Mai 2020) not all such children have been in attendance and some children who would not have met the definition of 'vulnerable' at the commencement of the lockdown will have become 'vulnerable' during the lockdown period.",,,"Any region","85300000 ",,beth.lord@education.gov.uk,"St. Paul&apos;s Place",,Sheffield,"S1 2JF",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,31/05/2020,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,7265000,,01/06/2020,7265000,"[Barnardo's|Tanners House, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1QG|NONE_OTHER||No|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,11:59

It is very likely that due to the restrictions people may not be with their loved ones at the time of their death or they may have witnessed traumatic scenes and it could have happened very quickly. Restrictions also mean that the usual practical and emotional support people can physically get from family and friends following a bereavement may not be there.

Our intention is to commission a regional helpline with a free phone/text number (underpinned by an online function so people can access via email) to support our population to be able to access the information and advice they need, and to be able to offer emotional health and wellbeing support as well as practical support. Individuals accessing the line will be supported to access the most appropriate support for their needs and this may well be linking to services much closer to their home/current residence.

This service is responding to a unique and evolving situation and we will need to evaluate capacity and use, as well as better understand the needs of our population, as we go. As such this specification is high level in content and we will work with chosen provider/s to evaluate and adapt their response as required.

A 24 hours a day 7 day a week telephone/text or email service offering information, advice and guidance a (both practical and emotional) provision for people who have experienced grief, sadness and/or loss or have been affected by bereavement through the Covid-19 phase in West Yorkshire and Harrogate.

Contract Period: - It is envisaged that this service will run for 12months as a minimum May -April 2021 (dependent on national policy/response offering new infrastructure) The service provider/s will be expected to continuously adapt to respond to changing need as we progress through this pandemic and therefore the specification is subject to change (in consultation with both the commissioner of the service and the provider/s)

Total Contract Value: - We anticipate funding up to 500 calls initially per month with the contract value being worked through with the provider/s and recognising that there may be start up/mobilisation costs

General Context
Bereavement, which is a difficult experience under any situation, including wider grief and loss is taking place under very challenging circumstances during the Covid-19 pandemic and will potentially be combined with feelings of fear and anger and mistrust. The number of deaths as a direct consequence of contracting Covid-19 in addition to deaths from other causes means that the average death rate has significantly increased and demand for bereavement support and advice in relation to grief and loss is on the increase.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","85312300 ","Brenda Powell",brenda.powell1@nhs.net,"Greater Huddersfield CCG, 2nd Floor, Norwich Union House",,Huddersfield,HD21GZ,England,"01484 464262",,,,"The tender was available on www.nhssourcing.co.uk ref: itt_5145",01/07/2020,30/04/2021,06/05/2020,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,150000,,12/06/2020,150000,"[Leeds Mind|Clarence House

\r
As part of the National Testing Strategy, Pillar 4's surveillance work endeavours to capture a nationwide picture of Covid-19's prevalence amongst the wider UK population.\r
Unlike the other demographic specific studies, the UK Biobank Seroprevalence Study is intended to capture [sero]prevalence data from across the country, both now and over the course of the next 6 months. The data from the study will be sent to DHSC on a weekly basis.\r
DHSC have partnered with the UK Biobank who are project managing the research, given their existing cohort of participants, operational and analytical expertise.\r
UK Biobank aims to collect monthly blood samples and symptom data (via a short questionnaire) from its participants (as well as from their children and grandchildren aged over 18) to enable an assessment of the extent of previous infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus (by measuring blood antibodies) in different locations and age groups across the UK.\r
The aim is to recruit a population-based sub-study from UK Biobank participants and their adult (i.e. aged over 18) children and grandchildren. It is expected that participants will contribute to the study for 6 months (extendable). The duration of the study will be determined by the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.\r
The objective of the study is to determine the extent of previous infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID‐19 (by collecting samples that can be measured for blood antibodies) in a nationally representative sample of the UK population.\r
The UK Biobank funded activities cover participant recruitment, sample collection, sample processing and storage, and provision of samples to the University of Oxford for sample assay to measure blood antibodies and reporting of infection rates based on returned quantitative assay data.\r

The centre has a stakeholder group that comprises the local authority (CBC) as owners of the facility, Dunstable Town Council as the centre managers, Dunstable Town Football Club, AFC Dunstable and the local county FA (Beds FA). Creasey Park is home to two local football clubs Dunstable Town FC and AFC Dunstable. Dunstable Town FC.
      
      Our main objective is to have a high-quality playing surface that fully meets the needs of our operator, Dunstable Town Council, and all existing customers/users and stakeholders, and to attract more customers/users to our facility. Also, that the surface and associated installation meets all the required standards (as detailed in the specification and tender documentation); is robust and hard-wearing; easy to maintain; fit for high usage and longevity; limits/mitigates the revenue impact/operational costs as much as possible; and also mitigates the overall environmental/health impact (e.g. rubber crumb) on the surrounding area (e.g. Greenbelt) and to all users and staff.
      
      We realise that due to the impact of Covid-19, including the enforced social distancing restrictions and lockdown, these could negatively impact on the timescales listed, as it will depended on the availability of the workforce; and the required materials via the supply chain being readily available in the required quantities; and Government advice and any restrictions in place. Also, these works are detailed in a submitted Planning Application (27th March 2020) and therefore, we will need to receive Planning approval before this installation can commence.
      
      Please see the specification and associated appendices, which detail the type/quality and quantity of products/materials etc. required in order to complete the installation of the 3G ATP.

In addition to the operating plant, the plant infrastructure includes a workshop, storage facilities and office space. The plant is fully manned 8am - 4pm Mon-Fri, with an out-of-hours emergency on-call roster in operation.  During peak periods, skeleton weekend coverage is sometimes necessary.

The service required under the contract is the operation of and planned & preventative maintenance to the mine water treatment plant including:
•	Carrying out daily checks on the plant, taking samples and carrying out maintenance activities
•	Making informed adjustments to the treatment process to ensure efficient use of chemicals and power

This will allow us to understand the discounts brought about by a longer term contract, however due to the foreseeable economic challenges in the market brought about by COVID-19 and the delay it has caused in migrating off products, it may be more prudent to go for a shorter term agreement at this time. 

Potential Suppliers should note the Agency does not commit to pay more than one year's pricing up front, and expects to pay annually in advance for each year of the contract

Licence renewals for Next Generation Threat Prevention (NGTP) IDS/IPS blade licensing provided by core Check Point firewalls are also included.

Potential suppliers must meet the following minimum criteria;

•	ISO27001 IT Security management accreditation;
•	Checkpoint Partner status of 3* or above.

All quotes must include the level of support / SLA's associated with the user centre 5887006 as a minimum; i.e. onsite support, 4 hour response 24/7 and include a Technical Account Manager (TAM). 

ITS are considering the benefits of several Check Point support offerings and therefore require quotes for: 

1.	Premium Support, NGTP Subscription, Technical Account Manager (ATAM).

2.	Premium Support with Diamond add on, NGTP Subscription, Technical Account Manager (ATAM).
ITS also require Check Point Professional Consultancy Services in the form of a call-off arrangement for up to 20 days per year.

Please note that whilst no new licences/support are required at this time, we want the scope of the contract to include the ability to purchase further licences/support at any time during the contract.

The support will cover the following items at DVLA:

As of March 2018, official statistics showed that the Bristol North Somerset South Gloucester (BNSSG) commissioning area has 75,920 people over the age of 75. North Somerset had 23,269 people over 75, this is predicted to increase to 37,000 in 2030. There is expected to be an increase of 88% by 2030 in the number of people living in care homes aged 75 and over. The number of people receiving residential care aged 85 and older has doubled compared with ages 75-84, yet there are half as many residents in North Somerset aged 85 and older. 

Dehydration in care homes is a nationally recognised concern, it is essential that people living in care homes are supported to remain healthy, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions and functional decline. Diagnosing dehydration in older people is challenging and requires consideration of several factors. Effective hydration management which promotes good hydration and nutrition in older adults leads to increased wellbeing and improved quality of life, dehydration should be preventable (Courtney et al, 2009). Current hydration monitoring is reactive, identifying when individuals are dehydrated then intervening with an appropriate medical response driven by the impact of dehydration on the individual.

A highly collaborative and agile discovery phase led the project team to propose the development of a progressive web-based app to support carers to prevent dehydration in care home residents. The app will use information from simple digitised assessments to develop an individual's hydration story which would appear as their profile within the app. The story will hold a complete picture of the support needed for individuals to remain hydrated. The assessments would be completed when an individual is admitted to the care home, reviews would be prompted by the app at appropriate regular intervals. The aim is to place individuals at the heart of hydration management to improve outcomes.

      The Council is seeking to appoint one contractor to undertake the replacement of soil and ventilation pipes within the Council's Housing stock primarily in its low, medium and high rise flatted accommodation. The soil and ventilation pipes are those that were installed at the time the buildings were built, typically in the 1950's and 1960's.
      
      The existing pipework generally decays from the inside irrespective of the material used, typically either cast iron, galvanised steel or copper. Problems also occur as a consequence of the build-up of material reducing the bore of the pipe. These two issues lead to leaks on the system which cause damp and foul smells within flats affected.

This release of methane from the rumen microbiome also results in 6-12% less energy being available to the animal therefore reducing methane emissions in ruminants will also likely improve upon their growth. Current agricultural policies have been designed to encourage agricultural practices which secure high yields of healthy food, but also must ensure environmental goals such as minimizing emission of greenhouse gases (GHG).  However, a common notion is that the required environmental performances necessarily result in lower productivity, but this may be due to a lack of knowledge and innovation. Novel, economically-viable solutions are required that secure high environmental performance while sustaining or even increasing productivity, enabling future food security for a growing population.

Utilisation of seaweeds (or seaweed byproducts) as an additive in ruminant feed represent a novel approach which has the potential to meet these requirements.  To date, some chemical compounds and seaweeds (3NOP, Asparagopsis taxiformis (tropical) and Asparagopsis armata (temperate)) have shown methane inhibitory effects in the laboratory (up to 99% reduction) and in limited animal studies. However, 3NOP and Asparagopsis sp. are not commercially viable due to (1) limited supply of seaweeds/seaweed bioactives; (2) animal health and food safety issues (potential carcinogen) and environmental concerns (negative effects on the ozone layer); (3) prohibitive costs and (4) limited aquaculture of Asparagopsis seaweeds. What is required is sustainably sourced seaweeds that can be used in animal feeds to modulate the rumen microbiome and reduce ruminant methane emissions, whilst ensuring animal health, fertility and productivity.

SEASOLUTIONS proposes to use natural and natively abundant seaweeds (harvested by licensed harvesting companies) as a source of feed additive to reach the requirements of long-term methane reduction, without negative effects on feed intake, the environment, productivity of animals or food and animals safety. This will be achieved by a cross disciplinary consortium of experts from 5 countries in Europe (Republic of Ireland, UK, Sweden, Norway and Germany) and 1 in North America (Canada). This team will: 1) investigate sustainable harvesting and preservation techniques for native seaweeds in sufficient quantities for use in animal feeds; 2) Characterise and select native seaweed species for lab and animal trials as feed additives based on their bioactive and safety profiles; 3) Evaluate the effects of selected seaweeds on total CH4 and nutrient production both in laboratory and in animal trials; 4) Identify the mechanisms through which the seaweed additives reduce methane in the rumen microbiome; 5) Explore novel cost-effective options for seaweed-based feed ingredie",,"BT9 5PX","Northern Ireland","73110000 ",,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,Defra,,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,,"MoA for the Provision of SCF02017 (SEASOLUTIONS) - REDACTIONS.pdf ",,"

The site came with both physical and ecological constraints, including; traversing main sewers, close proximity to the railway, the presence of Great Crested Newts and other amphibians / reptiles. As such, this project has experienced some delays. Nevertheless, the scheme has been designed around the physical constraints and CBC obtained a License from Natural England to clear the site, which was successfully completed in September 2019. The Council would like to use this development as an opportunity to ""pilot"" ultra-low energy homes to help tackle environmental concerns and fuel poverty within the Borough. Therefore, the Council now wishes to appoint a competent design & build contractor (ideally with experience of delivering ultra-low energy homes) to complete the detailed technical design and build these dwellings, including all associated works. To this end, it has prepared this single-stage fixed lump sum tender. In order to evaluate the cost benefit of these ultra-low energy homes, all Bidders are required to submit both a Primary Tender (Option 1) for the provision of ultra-low energy homes and a Secondary ""alternative"" Tender (Option 2) for homes that simply meet the minimum requirements of the current Building Regulations. It will be for Bidders to determine how they reduce the use of energy within their scheme (presumably using a combination of improvements to the building fabric and technology) and the extent of that reduction, while optimising the balance between energy savings and the resulting increases in installation costs.",,,"East Midlands","45000000 ",,procurement@corby.gov.uk,"George Street",,CORBY,NN171QG,England,,,"01.

A new bridge structure will also act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the Bedford Wharf site. This pedestrian and cycle bridge forms a vital link between the Railway Station and the Town Centre. 
      The bridge forms a key component of the Guildford Town Centre Transport Package, with the remaining funding workstream from the M3 LEP secured in March 2016.

The scope of which will include drug and alcohol treatment services, domestic abuse andsexual violence services and supported housing. Because of the novel nature of commissioning and procuringthese services, there are large aspects that are untested and therefore need a comprehensive level of rigourapplied to test the process.
It was initially anticipated that any new service contracts would commence on 01 October 2020 and contractswith existing providers were awarded directly, following publication of a previous VEAT notice.
Since March 2019 the Council has been working extensively with the market, to establish the Alliance principlesand model. In addition, since this time a new Council administration has been put in place and consultation withelected members, has been on-going. This has impacted on timescales for decision making and agreement of budgets, resulting in a delay to the originally proposed contract start date. The necessary procurement process is due to commence in May 2020, with an anticipated contract start date of 06 June 2021.
As a result Torbay council proposes to issue directly award nine month contracts to incumbent providers, subject to internal approval, to provide stability in the system whilst this innovative procurement is undertaken.

Negotiated procedure without prior publication
The works, supplies or services can be provided only by a particular economic operator for the following reason:
• absence of competition for technical reasons
Explanation:
The Authority not yet entered into new contracts with these suppliers & is advising the market that, subject to internal approval & outcome of this VEAT process, is intending to do so.
We are awarding contract without prior publication under paragraphs 2(b)(ii) & 5 of Article 32 of Directive 2014/24/EU. The technical reason 2(b)(ii) being that setting up an Alliance for future contracting is a new approach, which will require sufficient time to engage with the market to ensure they fully understand the concept & the culture shift required to work in this way. It was initially anticipated that any new service contracts would start on 01 Oct 2020 & contracts with existing providers were awarded directly, following publication of a previous VEAT.
Since March 2019 the Council has been working extensively with the market to establish the Alliance principles & model. In addition, since then a new Council administration has been put in place & consultation with elected members has been on-going & has impacted on timescales for decision making & agreement of budgets, resulting in a delay to the originally proposed contract start date. The necessary procurement process is due to start in May 2020, with an anticipated contract start date of 07 June 2021. This will include time required for Alliance members to adapt to this new way of working & develop a new service model prior to commencing delivery.
The Council has a duty to provide these services & cannot be without provision for any period of time. Procurement of a short term arrangement to meet needs whilst requirements are properly established is not considered practical as it:
Will remove focus from the procurement of the alliance & the considerable market development needed which could result in further delays to commissioning new services.  
Will result in additional cost & inconvenience to the authority & suppliers who would be required to participate in 2 procurements rather than 1.
Is in the best interests of the people already using the services to keep to a minimum the number of times they need to transition from one service provider to another.
In accordance with para. 5 of Article 32 of Directive 2014/24/EU the new contracts will provide identical services to those being delivered by the suppliers under contracts, which were procured in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 2014/24/EU or awarded in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 2014/24/EU.
Due to the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, the Council is unsure at this time whether the timescales for this new procurement process are achievable. In the event that the pandemic results in delays to the procurement process, the Council will publish a revised timetable, when this can be established.",01/10/2020,06/06/2021,19/05/2020,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1336720,1336720,11/06/2020,1336720,"[Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust|Torquay|NONE||No|No][Langley House Trust|Croydon|NONE||No|No][Sanctuary Housing Association (T/A Sanctuary Supported Living)|Worcester|NONE||No|No]",,01/10/2020,06/06/2021,"DirectAward ",

To this end the Trust wishes to procure a set of EPR consultancy services in order to support the delivery of the following artefacts consistent with HMRC Green Book in order to fully explore the options available for the EPR:

The support will require a specialist consultancy with a proven track record of providing high-quality EPR consultancy services, with specific expertise in EPR market knowledge, stakeholder engagement, EPR requirements elicitation and definition, EPR market knowledge, public sector procurement, EPR procurement and EPR business case development. This will ensure the selection of an EPR solution aligns with the Trust's overall strategic objectives within the context of the complex and ever changing NHS provider landscape.

NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) are working on behalf of NHS Southport & Formby CCG and NHS South Sefton CCG who are making a contract award for COVID - 19 Urgent Eyecare Services (CUES) to Primary Eyecare Services Ltd.

This is contract award is being made due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In response to national COVID-19 guidance, hospital ophthalmology departments have reduced all routine out-patient and surgical activity, providing services only for high risk patients and emergency care.  As a consequence, there is a risk that patients with urgent eye health issues will find it difficult to access care or may choose not to access care from a hospital setting, with potential implications for their sight and long-term eye health.

The CUES service will:
•	safely deliver urgent eye care in the community
•	deliver remote triage and consultations (by telephone or video) to minimise face-to-face appointments
•	make use of technology to reduce patient - practitioner contact time
•	reduce the expected burden on the rest of primary care (GP practices) and reduce pressures on ophthalmology departments within secondary care
•	maintain local access to quality eyecare services for the local population

The contract will be awarded to be delivered on a case-by-case basis and it is anticipated that the contract value will be approximately £87,864 per annum.  The contract is being awarded for a 12-month period with the option to extend for a further 1 x 12-month period.

New digital behaviours, particularly for younger audiences, means that it is becoming increasingly challenging to reach young audiences solely through promotion on our owned media channels. Thus, it is essential, in order to fulfil our responsibilities, that we use paid for media channels to complement our owned media.

The BBC has therefore procured a media agency to manage the planning, buying and return on investment evaluation of external media activity, as well as delivering strategic insights and analysis of the wider emerging media market. This is critical to ensure we deliver value for money to the UK public.

The maximum contract duration is up to 4 years, with the annual contract value incorporating both the paid media budget and agency fees estimated at GBP 25 m p.a.

For the BBC to meet its public service obligations, it is essential that all audiences are aware of the programmes and services that we create. To ensure that we reach all audiences effectively, particularly younger audiences who are spending less time on our owned platforms, we need to use paid for media alongside our owned media. Investing in paid media ensures we are able to engage critical audiences with the right reach and frequency to create awareness of the programmes and services they have paid for through their licence fee.",,,"Any region","79341400 ",,hannah.stevenson@bbc.co.uk,"Broadcasting House, Portland Place",,London,"W1A 1AA",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/05/2024,06/09/2019,YES,tender_213470/790560,Yes,No,No,Services,100000000,,01/06/2020,100000000,"[Havas Media Ltd|London, UK|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,01/06/2020,31/05/2024,"CompetitiveProcedureWithNegotiationOJEU ",

The service will be delivered by a specialist team of experts, linking in with partner agencies and work together with service users to utilise their personal strengths to improve safety and wellbeing.

The service will deliver the following key elements:

• A service provided by a specialist team of expert practitioners who provide direct support to people who are one or more of the following:

- At medium or high risk of harm

- Remaining in their relationships

- Have complex needs

- Rebuilding or recovering from abuse

• A framework and principles that links voluntary and statutory services with the needs of adults experiencing any or all of the above to provide a truly collaborative multi-agency response.

• A range of programmes to support direct work with service users and links group work and peer support; service user led groups to inform and influence service delivery.

The workforce will be suitably qualified in order to undertake their roles and will have opportunities to further enhance their skills.
