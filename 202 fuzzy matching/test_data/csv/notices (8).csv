The following 15 Clinical Commissioning Groups are collaborating to procure an NHS111 and Clinical Assessment Service across Kent, Medway and Sussex; NHS Swale, NHS West Kent, NHS Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley, NHS Medway, NHS Ashford, NHS Canterbury and Coastal, NHS South Kent Coast, NHS Thanet, NHS Coastal West Sussex, NHS Brighton and Hove, NHS Horsham and Mid Sussex, NHS Crawley, NHS High Weald Lewes Havens, NHS Eastbourne, Hailsham and Seaford, NHS Hastings and Rother Clinical Commissioning Groups.

The contract will be for a period of 5 years with the option to extend for a further 2 years subject, but not limited to satisfactory performance.

The Council is orientating this procurement towards the open procedure as described in Regulations but using a ""light touch"" approach. The Council does not hold itself bound by the Regulations except to the extent that they apply to the light touch regime as set out in Regulations 74 to 76 of the Regulations.
 
In Croydon we are lucky enough to have one of the largest VCS in London. The sector here is strong, vibrant and diverse and is a key player in delivering services and support to some of Croydon's most vulnerable residents. VCS groups and organisations are able to reach places and people that statutory agencies often cannot and have a greater ability to adapt to the evolving needs of the community. To ensure the sector is able to continue playing this role, the Council has committed to investing £2.6m per annum for up to 3 years through the Community Fund. 

Through the Outcomes Programme, the Council are looking to fund bids which demonstrate the following commissioning principles:-

•	Does the bid involve collaboration with other VCS groups?
•	Is it tackling a particular need in a locality?
•	Does it focus on prevention, early identification and intervention?
•	Does it support one or more of the priority outcomes?
•	Is it evidence based?
•	Is it innovative?

This Outcomes Prospectus provides information on the key outcome themes which the Council wants to commission, as well as a guide on how to apply and how bids will be evaluated. Croydon Council welcomes bids from Voluntary and Community Sector organisations who can deliver projects and services in the borough, which will contribute to one of Croydon's 5 outcome priorities. We are looking to support projects which will deliver positive change and benefits for individuals or communities within Croydon. The 5 outcome priorities include:

Outcome 1: People live long, healthy, happy and independent lives
Outcome 2: Our children and young people thrive and reach their full potential
Outcome 3: Access to homes and prevention of homelessness
Outcome 4: Everyone feels safer in their street, neighbourhood and home
Outcome 5: Everybody has the opportunity to work and build their career

Tender Applications are for bids over £15,000 per annum.

Experts by experience are people who have personal experience of the services we regulate, either directly or as carers.
During inspections, experts by experience speak with people using services and their family or organisations that support them. They may also watch how the service is delivered and speak to staff. Their findings are used to support inspectors' judgements on services and may be included in inspection reports.
We want experts by experience to provide three types of support:
- inspection - support to site visits and telephone calls,
- monitor and insight - support gathering local and national information from the public. This will include special reviews and investigations as well as work raising public awareness of CQC,
- co-production - support to policy and guidance development and delivery of CQC staff training.
To aid CQC in developing its ways of working, the day-to-day activities of ExE will be managed by an external organisation on CQC's behalf, which will involve the co-ordination and arrangement of activities.

CQC is seeking to utilise the Restricted Procedure (as defined in Regulation 28 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015) and also employing the provisions of the Light Touch Regime (LTR) as detailed in Regulations 74 to 76 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015.
In accordance with Regulation 28 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015, only those economic operators who have passed an initial, qualitative, selection criteria will be invited to tender to provide the service by CQC.

During the life of the Contract including any period(s) of extension(s), CQC reserves the right to modify the Services as described in this Statement of Requirements, Core Services A and Additional Services B relying on Regulation 72 (1)(a) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, without a new procurement irrespective of the monetary value of the modification.

The competition is split into 5 lots, meeting the needs of different aspect of the Hy4Heat objectives. 

This SBRI competition focuses on the development of commercial hydrogen appliances, boiler systems and ancillary system components to demonstrate the safe use of hydrogen as a fuel in providing commercial catering, heating and hot water requirements. It aims to provide critical evidence of end use application, safety, in-use emissions, and functionality.

The competition is split into five lots: 
•	Lot 1: Catering and Production Heating
•	Lot 2: Dry Space Heating 
•	Lot 3: Wet Space Heating
•	Lot 4: Combined Heat and Power
•	Lot 5: Ancillary System Components.
The Competition will be delivered against specified milestones for each of the lots

It is expected that proposals will target projects which will maximise technical benefit in demonstrating the use of hydrogen in the commercial sector. This would likely include appliance types that are common in the market as well as those for which hydrogen replacements are more technically challenging to develop.

The total potential value of the Competition is up to £4.9m (excl. VAT) although BEIS may allocate less than this depending on the quality of the applications received. Up to 27 innovation projects will be funded through the competition (a maximum of two or three projects across each of the appliance types).

This Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) competition will run until March 2021, and is aiming to deliver: 
•	Prototype Appliances that demonstrate the feasibility of commercial hydrogen appliance development. Prototypes may either be:
•	Safety certified, referred to as the core requirement of the ITT. or;
•	Fully certified and have demonstrated the safety certified appliances for a minimum of 2 months within an unoccupied demonstration trial. Referred to as the core+ requirement of the ITT.
•	Boiler Systems: Development of control systems for cascades of hydrogen boilers. 
•	Ancillary System Components: A set of components demonstrating safe installation of hydrogen appliances in buildings. 
Categories have been made into sub-lots in order for bids within the same sub-category to be fairly assessed on cost. It is anticipated that between two and three projects per sub-category will be selected. Funding will be allocated to the highest scoring bids in each sub-lot, and then allocated in ranked order from the highest scores in each sub-lot until the funding limit is reached. Exceptions to this may include: 
•	Bids of insufficient quality; 
•	Bids that do not meet the ITT requirements; 
•	If funding has been allocated to identical technology of a higher score;
•	If there is an imbalance of bids across the lots.",,,"Any region","24111600 39715000 39721410 39721411 39722000 42131140 42164000 42340000 44163160 44163200 44621200 44621221 71321200 73000000 ","Steve Loades",builtenviromentinnovation@beis.gov.uk,"1 Victoria Street",,London,SW1H0ET,England,,,"Hy4Heat WP5b - TRN 1996_07_2019 -ITT-Q&A.pdf Hy4Heat WP5b - TRN 1996_07_2019 - Terms and Conditions (1).pdf Hy4Heat WP5b - TRN 1996_07_2019 - Application Form (1).docx Hy4Heat WP5b TRN 1996 07 2019 GDPR assurance questionaire.xlsx Hy4Heat WP5b TRN 1996 07 2019 Pricing Schedule.docx Hy4Heat WP5b - TRN 1996_07_2019 -ITT- clarification questions set 2 revision A.pdf Hy4Heat WP5b - TRN 1996_07_2019 -ITT- revision C.pdf Hy4Heat WP5b - TRN 1996_07_2019 -ITT- clarification questions set 3.pdf ",,"19/09/19: A final set of clarification questions have been answered and the ITT has been re-issued with milestone 6 amended (on pages 15, 34, 45 and 46) to specify only one fully boxed appliance to be delivered for Lot 3A: Burner integrated with a shell boiler (>400 kW) and Lot 4: Combined Heat and Power.

•	Dorset (including Bournemouth, Christchurch & Poole)
•	Hampshire
•	Solent (Portsmouth, Southampton & the Isle of Wight)

The purpose of national immunisation programmes is to protect the population from vaccine preventable illnesses and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality and the burden this places on health services. This includes reducing the risk of individuals infecting others (herd immunity), particularly those who cannot be vaccinated either because they are too young or for medical reasons. Collectively the programmes protect young people against a range of infectious diseases which can lead to death or severe, permanent disability requiring long term care such as limb amputations, brain injury, paralysis and cancer.   

The aim of the project is to secure provision, for each of the Lots, which can achieve and sustain high levels of coverage  of the immunisation programmes in scope overall as well as at the level of individual schools/communities and population groups e.g. those who typically have difficulty accessing services. Coverage will be measured in the year the vaccination is first offered and in subsequent school years. The ambition is to be in the top quartile for the country for each vaccination programme and in each lot.  

There are currently four programmes for children of school age relevant to this procurement:
•	the Seasonal Influenza immunisation programme
•	the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) immunisation programme
•	the Tetanus, Diphtheria and inactivated Polio (Td/IPV) adolescent booster programme 
•	the Meningitis ACWY immunisation programme

In addition, the provider will offer a catch-up service for under-immunised children in line with the national measles eradication strategy. 

The programmes are continually evolving. By 2020, the HPV programme will have been extended to boys as well as girls and the flu programme will have been extended to school year 6. Further school years may be announced for the flu programme in due course. The scope may also be extended in future to include additional programmes, as advised/ recommended by the Joint Committee of Vaccinations and Immunisations and/or at the request of the commissioner. Any provider will have to demonstrate an ability to respond positively to programme changes and implement them in a timely fashion to a high standard.  

The contract term will be 5 years, with the option to extend by a further 2 years, and will commence on 1st August 2020. 

Interested parties were allowed to bid for one or more lots. Evaluations were based on Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT).

The NHS England and NHS Improvement document ""Securing Excellence in Commissioning NHS Dental Services"" (February 2013) referenced the need for the commissioning of care pathways which would be underpinned by the nationally-defined Levels of Complexity.
The purpose of this procurement is two-fold: to commission a Level 2 endodontic service in Ealing, Hounslow and Bromley which offers patients a consistent pathway in line with all the other London regions and to alleviate 18-week Referral to Treatment pressures in London secondary care (hospital) settings.  Triaging arrangements for the new service will be via the London secondary care restorative providers, ensuring full consultant-led (Levels 3a / 3b) oversight of the referrals process.
The Authority intends to commission these services through 2 contracts (2 Lots), Lot 1 - Ealing and Hounslow and Lot 2 - Bromley.
Details of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that relate to the Level 2 endodontic service are details within the service specification. In addition to this, the NHS England and NHS Improvement (London Region) proposed Accreditation of Level 2 Performers is also detailed within the service specification.
Contracts will be awarded for an initial period of three (3) years, with an optional extension for a further one (1) year. Therefore, the maximum duration of this contract, if the extension option is taken up it will be four (4) years.  The contractual framework for the Level 2 endodontic service will be the national Personal Dental Services (PDS) agreement.

Design and deliver a bespoke, class-room based, Advanced Trade Policy (ATP) training programme.
The ATP supports the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Trade Policy and Negotiations Faculty (the 'Faculty') programme to ensure civil servants improve their trade policy expertise.

ATP is aimed above the Practitioner level to complement the Faculty's Expert Deep Dive and international negotiation programmes. 

ATP Learners will gain the skills and knowledge they need to develop and deliver trade and investment policy effectively. The course will cover a range of trade policy issues relevant to the UK government. These include:

-	the role and impact of a trade regime in supporting UK priorities abroad;
-	the impact of a trade regime on key national policy areas; 
-	improving UK access to overseas markets.
-	How  trade objectives can be achieved through different vehicles.

This course is aimed at civil servants who are generalists. 

They work on cross-cutting trade policy, across a wide range of government departments. They need a more thorough knowledge in all facets of trade than is provided for at Practitioner level. 

Candidates for the ATP have completed the Practitioner level or already have the equivalent knowledge. 

Candidates are responsible for implementing trade policy at a senior level. They may contribute to the development of trade strategy. 

ATP should focus on developing a breadth of knowledge across a range of trade policy portfolios. The goal is to give officers the skills to assess the impact of international trade regimes on trade strategy and policy across government.  

ATP is not aimed at specialist chapter leads or chief negotiators. These officers will use the Deep Dive programme that specialises in providing in-depth knowledge of specific trade topics. ATP candidates may progress to the Deep Dive programme if they need a profound knowledge of specialist areas of trade regimes.
ATP should not cover negotiations strategy or skills.

TFL001-DN429082-22617058,Contract,"Transport for London",Awarded,2020-01-10T00:00:00Z,"ICT12645 Victoria Coach Station (VCS) Bus Information Display System (BIDS)","Victoria Coach Station (VCS) is a subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL).The primary role of the company is to provide an arrivals and departures facility for coaches in London, with off-street setting down and picking-up. Underpinning the operations of VCS is the Bus Information Display System (BIDS), which has been in use at VCS since 1996 and due to its age has a number of functional limitations. Hence TfL are looking to replace the current system with a new system to meet VCS's current and future requirements.

This procurement envisages a commercial off the shelf BIDS software package with a level of configurability to accommodate TfL specific requirements. The main requirement is to migrate from the existing system and the deployment of the new system. Software licences, support and maintenance, hardware and additional services including consultancy and advice in respect of the system are also included in scope.

The objective of the Bus Information Display System (BIDS) Procurement is to appoint a supplier to replace the current system with a new system to meet Victoria Coach Station (VCS) current and future requirements. The chosen Supplier will:
1) Deliver the invoicing system and any other commercial off the shelf (COTS) products included in the successful supplier tender in Phase 1 (ideally prior to 2.4.2020);
2) Deliver Phase 2 (including the rest of the system, required configuration and any development work needed to meet TfL's requirements); and
3) Thereafter, support and maintenance of the BIDS System.

The objectives underpin the benefits expected by the business, and provide an insight to what the final solution must deliver are as follows:
1) More timely and accurate production of Arrivals and Departures Schedules;
2) Digital recording (and automation if practicable), of coach Arrivals and Departures from VCS, thereby improving the quality and accuracy of information recorded;
3) More timely and accurate production of invoices required to bill coach operators for the services provided by VCS;
4) Automation of the production of management information; and
5) Enabling customers to independently acquire arrivals or departures information via Information Kiosks to be located at VCS.

Local Government Reorganisation has taken place in the County of Dorset, which resulted in a new Dorset Council on 1 April 2019 replacing the former district and borough councils (East Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset, Weymouth & Portland) and the former Dorset County Council. The banking arrangements maintained by the former councils are currently provided by a range of different banks and these arrangements will continue until the new banking contract for Dorset Council is implemented.  

Dorset Council requires a comprehensive money transmission banking service involving maintenance of numerous bank accounts, handling of paper, BACS and CHAPS clearing, cash processing and other activities associated with local authority banking business. 
The Council will require an internet banking service for balance/transaction reporting and payment initiation. 

It is anticipated that the contract will commence immediately after final award and run for a period of 5 years. The Council will require the option to extend the contract for a further 3 years (making a maximum possible contract length of 8 years). 

Given the complexities of consolidating the banking arrangements, it is very unlikely that all services/requirements will be fully implemented by 1st April 2020. It is likely that different arrangements will be transferred to the new banking contract over an extended period of time up to and following 1st April 2020

UKRI-STFC require a flip chip bonder which will perform the assembly of such a range of radiation sensitive detectors. The detectors generally consist of a 2D array of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) readout integrated circuit (ROIC), bonded to a geometrically similar 2D array of solid-state sensor material to form a hybrid pixel sensor. In many cases, the ROIC is silicon, but often the sensor is selected to provide specific detection properties for the radiation range being sensed. This means that a wide variety of sensor materials are possible, including but not limited to silicon, germanium, cadmium telluride, cadmium zinc telluride, gallium arsenide and gallium antimonide.
 
Most of the projects are small volume (1-5 units), high value runs, but it is also required to perform higher volume assemblies of a few 10s, 100s or potentially 2000-3000 units. Small volume runs must be accommodated by creating breaks during larger runs, necessitating rapid turn reconfigurations.

The assembly facility is currently going through a major upgrade and will be moving into new custom built premises and looking to build on that improvement by enhancing the bonding and assembly capabilities. Floor space has been allocated with service provision installed for a typical flip chip bonder.

UKRI-STFC has an established flip chip and die placement capability which utilises a range of bond processes but there is a recognised need to future proof the assembly infrastructure, increase the capacity and provide for making process enhancements to enable assembling higher numbers of more densely packed pixels. There are also plans to extend the range of processes which can be supported in the future, giving the ability to offer more than the current core flip chip processes.

Services being procured are Chest surgery (trans masculine), Genital surgery (trans feminine) and Genital surgery (trans masculine).

The Services will be available to individuals eligible for NHS-funded care who are ordinarily resident in England, Scotland or Wales - or otherwise who are the commissioning responsibility of the NHS in England, Scotland or Wales - and who meet the eligibility criteria described in the Service Specification. Successful Bidders will hold a single contract with NHS England for services provided to eligible patients who are the commissioning responsibility of NHS England, NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.

The NHS pathway of care for adults with gender dysphoria will differ according to the individual's goals. The envisaged adult pathway may typically be summarised as: 

•	Referral to a specialist Gender Dysphoria Clinic 
•	Assessment for gender dysphoria, and diagnosis
•	Individuals who meet the criteria for diagnosis of gender dysphoria are accepted on to the NHS care pathway and an individual treatment plan is agreed between the individual and their lead clinician in the Gender Dysphoria Clinic
•	Certain therapeutic interventions are delivered by the Gender Dysphoria Clinic; and / or referral for interventions with other providers; which may include recommendations to primary care for prescribing endocrine treatments
•	Gender Dysphoria Clinic makes a referral for surgical interventions of the chest and genitals if criteria are met via a planned National Referral Support Service
•	Ongoing review and monitoring during and after interventions
•	Conclusion of contact: discharge to primary care

The Leaving Care Service fulfils a statutory duty of the Local Authority and must meet the requirements of the Care Leavers (England) Regulations 2010 and the Children Act 1989. Further details of the service are contained within the tender documents, notably 'Document 1 - Information for Bidders and Service Specification'.
Throughout the contract period, suppliers are asked to note that Lincolnshire County Council may provide additional resources (subject to evidence of need and related service impact) for any of the following reasons:
• An increase in care leaver numbers above tolerances set out in the Service Specification
• An increase in complexity of care leaver needs
• Changes in statutory guidance, legislation or case law that will impact on service delivery.
Where Lincolnshire County Council is able to provide in-kind support to enhance the delivery of the service, any resulting in cost savings should be reinvested by the supplier back into service delivery.
The majority of care leavers live within Lincolnshire. Approximately 42% are based out of county; the majority of these are resident in bordering Local Authorities but can be anywhere in the UK.
All clarifications should be submitted through the ProContract procurement portal, as should tender submissions.
The clarification deadline is Monday 14th October at 12.00pm (noon) and the tender will close on Monday 28th October at 12.00pm (noon).
To further detail our requirement for the Lincolnshire Leaving Care Service, a supplier briefing event will take place on the afternoon of Monday 7th October at Lincoln Myle Cross Centre, Macaulay Drive. Lincoln, LN2 4EN.

Typically defined as a 'whole house' approach, this appreciates the complex interactions between fabric, ventilation and the occupant.
      
      This presents opportunities for:
      
      •Retrofit measures to contribute more effectively than if they were applied individually
      •Reducing the risk of unintended consequences by considering system-level impact
      To evaluate the potential of whole house retrofit, BEIS requires evidence, through the DEEP project, to explore the limitations, risks and benefits. This evidence should be produced through a combination of measurement and modelling, and will be used to inform our future retrofit strategy.

•	Undertake the National Project Manager role, being the UK representative to the study and inputting to decisions on how PISA 2021 will be run.
•	Administer PISA 2021 in the UK (excluding Scotland) according to the specification agreed at international level by the PISA Board of Participating Countries, and meeting OECD requirements in order that data for the UK is included within the international dataset, analysis and reporting.

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether, as well as requiring early identification should custodial sentences be applied.

The aim of the L&D Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (adults, children & young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams, court staff or any other referral process (including self-referral), offering  critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing.  The service will also act as a point of referral and follow-up for service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, community treatment and rehabilitation appointments.
 
The primary focus of this service is improved outcomes for service users, not financial savings.

Key outcomes include:
•	Improved access to healthcare and support services for vulnerable individuals and a reduction in health inequalities, prioritising female detained persons and those under the age of 18.
•	Diversion of individuals, where appropriate, out of the youth and criminal justice systems into health, social care, education and training, or other supportive services
•	To deliver efficiencies within the youth and criminal justice systems 
•	To reduce re-offending and/or escalation of offending behaviours

The service specification expanded on these outcomes, outlining what commissioners required of providers through the life of the contract
 
The total contract value of Liaison and Diversion Services is £1,128,965 per annum, with a total contract lifecycle value of £3,386,895 over 3 years, and a possible extension of an additional 2 years.  The initial 3 year period will commence from 01 April 2020.

The project will be run in state maintained schools in England, with MFL undergraduate students from universities in England as mentors. The pupils will be of mixed abilities, mixed gender and mixed socio-economic backgrounds. We are particularly interested in the capacity for the project to affect the choices of disadvantaged pupils and pupils who might not otherwise choose a language. The project's ambition is to inspire them to choose to study languages at GCSE level.
This is a digital project (as well as involving face to face visits) - using a digital platform to host interesting and stimulating digital resources to spark pupils' attention related to global culture and the value of languages. (The digital platform is being developed under a separate contract).
The private beta phase will run in at least 40 schools in England, from late January 2020 to the end of February or early March. The project will be delivered by the time Year 9 pupils make their subject choices for GCSEs. Mentors will work with small groups of 10-12 pupils, with a total pool of at least 1,000 pupils. The contract includes the option to progress to the public beta phase of the pilot, to run in academic year 2020-21 with a pool of at least 6,000 pupils (subject to approval and funding). 
The Provider will be required to;
-	run a dedicated programme of engagement, continuing the approach from the alpha phase. Activities from the alpha pilot will be available to bidders on request.
-	work with the Department to develop a robust evaluation model that provides clear evidence of the impact on participating pupils, including both qualitative and quantitative data. 
-	collaborate with the DfE product manager to prepare for the GDS service assessment at the end of the private beta pilot, focusing on the digital platform and compliance with GDS standards. 
-	commission user research to shape and evaluate the digital platform. The user research will need to be compatible with and support assessment of the platform against GDS standards.
-	work with digital experts within the DfE and third parties who will review the digital platform in line with the GDS specifications. The DfE digital team will look at specific digital elements such as security and data protection, in order to support with GDS assessments and advise on future expansion of the digital element of the project.",,,"Any region","80000000 ",,languages.info@education.gov.uk,"Sanctury Buildings, Great Smith Street",,London,"SW1P 3BT",England,,,"Redacted Contract.pdf ",,,01/11/2019,31/08/2020,20/09/2019,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,200000,,16/10/2019,1900000,"[Cardiff University|7th Floor, 30-36 Newport Road, Cardiff, CF24 0DE|COMPANIES_HOUSE|RC000089|No|No]",,01/11/2019,31/08/2020,"OpenOJEU ",

The contract will encompass survey design, fieldwork, data provision, managing data access and report writing. 
The Department for Education has an excellent track record of managing high-quality longitudinal studies which have been used effectively to influence policies affecting young people and their families. We plan to build on this success by undertaking additional waves of LSYPE2.
LSYPE2 is currently in its seventh wave and here we invite suitable organisations to express interest in conducting waves 8 and 9.  
Wave 8 will survey only those young people who have been involved in Further Education or are presently in Higher Education (FE or HE) at ages 20/21. Wave 9 will survey the entire cohort at ages 24/25 following a re-contact exercise. A 'keep in touch' strategy will be in place between these waves to help sustain engagement of the whole cohort.  
Complimenting waves 6 and 7, wave 8 will collect a range of data about the decisions that young people make during FE and HE, their experiences of these phases of education, and their preparedness for work. These topics are of key interest to policy makers, as are the economic and wellbeing outcomes of all young people once they have left education, which will be the focus of wave 9. 
As LSYPE2 is an established longitudinal study, it will be important to maintain high standards and consistency with previous waves. The sampling frame for wave 8 will be those participating in wave 7. The fieldwork will begin in March 2020.
For wave 8 (age 20/21), only those who have ever been involved in FE (excluding school sixth form) or those who are currently in HE will be surveyed using web and telephone surveys. For wave 9 (age 24/25), the full cohort will be surveyed using the sequential mixed mode design of earlier waves. 
As there will be a four year gap between waves 8 and 9, it will be important to run an effective, annual 'keep in touch' strategy with the cohort will be used to re-engage participants lost to the study in advance of wave 9. 
As outputs for each wave, we require high quality, timely, cleaned and fully weighted datasets suitable for conducting high quality analysis, and research and technical reports which meet Department standards.

Also, as a pre-condition to their Tenders being evaluated, organisations will have to satisfy the mandatory and discretionary grounds for exclusion contained in the Selection Questionnaire.

The Authority carries out financial appraisals of all organisations that Tender for the Authority's contracts to ensure that such organisations satisfy the Authority's minimum standards of economic and financial standing.

The academic year is based on a calendar of 195 days. Five days are to be used for staff professional development which means that School will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.

The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all school catering services, which currently includes breakfast, morning break, lunch, hospitality and free issue requirements. Free School Meals are to be charged on consumption numbers. There may be a small requirement for hospitality and this will be charged at net food cost.

As a school continually seeking ways to improve and develop the ethos and environment for students and staff, to give them the facilities they deserve and need to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, any consideration regarding inward capital investment as part of the supplier's tender submission would be welcomed.

This tender is for:
- Management of the whole NAAS assessment delivery system including
o Operational delivery of NAAS assessment centres, which includes delivery of practice simulation with actors
o Continuation of existing digital platform
o Governance of the service
o Delivery of a minimum of 800 high quality assessments to a maximum of 1950 high quality assessments between September 2019 and March 2020
- Monthly light touch support and universal communications offer to NAAS site employers
- Collaborative working with users, stakeholders and partners
To ensure the continued delivery of assessment centres, 65 centres have been booked for the period September 2019-December 2019, using additional funding outside of this contract to pay for; venues, staff (a centre manager, assessment facilitators, assessors and actors) and logistical arrangements for the IT equipment to be delivered to the centres by courier.

In such a fast-paced environment, it is therefore increasingly crucial that there is a comprehensive application testing regime in place, aligned with the development lifecycle, to ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and prioritised accordingly for remediation.
The Universal Credit Programme requires a culture of continuous vulnerability assessment to align with the existing continuous integration (CI) pipeline.  The DWP therefore require an Agile Security Testing service  to complement our developers, DevOps and the Secure Design team to continuously test existing and new features as they iterate to feed into the Development lifecycle.

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had a requirement to collect evidence from households receiving a measure under ECO to fill existing evidence gaps.
ECO3 is the most focused of the supplier obligation schemes to-date, with funding more narrowly targeted than previously at households who are low-income, vulnerable and at risk of fuel poverty. This focus places an increased need for BEIS to demonstrate which households receive ECO measures. Household demographics are therefore a research priority and feature strongly in the research questions listed below.
As set out in the introduction section, the policy is at a key point in its development cycle. The Clean Growth Strategy has committed to funding domestic energy efficiency until 2028 at least at current ECO levels, however, the current ECO3 scheme is due to expire in 2022.

Materials from which these two suits are manufactured have been discontinued by the supplier (WL Gore) and the manufacturer (Remploy Frontline Limited) is no longer trading. CR1 has successfully been withdrawn and stocks of the QDPPE have begun to deplete as their ten-year shelf-life recommended by the manufacturer approaches. 

Both The National CBRN Centre and Home Office, Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) have identified the need to consider Police CBRN PPE requirements in the context of preparing for emergencies involving contaminants that may have been deliberately or accidentally released and emergencies that may involve elements of more than one terrorist attack planning scenario.

The requirements for the assessment of structures on the railway were given in NR/SP/CIV/035: Assessment of Structures (NR, 2004). Network Rail's standard adopted a two stage assessment process comprising of Level 1 and Level 2 assessment. Level 1, the simplest level, and Level 2 typically including advanced methods of structural analysis.  
In 2011 Network Rail developed an assessment technique to support the rapid delivery of an Assessment Programme which covered 13,431 bridge assessments across the network. The new assessment technique is described as a Level 0 assessment. 
The Level 0 assessment is a simplified assessment based on principal checks of critical sections and conservative load distribution. First time assessment of structures using a Level 0 approach is generally based on recorded information and supplementary site investigations as determined by the Asset Engineer.
We require the successful consultant to review the use of the Level 0 tool, assessment processes and its impact in the asset's long term management as set out in 2.2.",,,"Any region","72225000 ",,barbara.augusto@orr.gov.uk,"1 Kemble Street",,LONDON,WC2B4AN,England,,,"ORR CT 19-19 Form of Agreement.doc ORR CT 19-19 Form of Tender.doc ORR CT 19-19 DISCLAIMER.doc Bravosolution Joining Instruction for open tender.doc ORR CT 19-19 ITT Targeted Assurance Review.doc ",,"Please apply directly to the buyer using the contact details provided, or follow the instructions given in the notice description or information section.",20/09/2019,16/12/2019,02/09/2019,YES,ORR/CT/19-19,Yes,No,No,Services,15000,25000,19/09/2019,1670625,"[Aecom|63-77 Victoria Street

1.	Refining current systems and approach: There is a recognised need to strengthen the West Africa CSSF's approach to measuring results and impact and to support the alignment of all programmes with their overarching strategies.

2.	Taking forward a portfolio approach to measuring effects and impact: the supplier will assist HMG in delivering improved M&E processes across projects, programmes and in particular at the portfolio level to ensure accurate capture of our activities outputs, outcomes and impact.  Further, the supplier will develop an approach to build a stronger understanding of the value for money of CSSF programmes in West Africa
3.	Learning: We aim to build a robust evidence base to strengthen learning and an understanding of what works and why at project, programme and portfolio level as well as across specific thematic areas, such as gender, relevant across West Africa. This includes better capturing the impact, synergies, added value and challenges of cross-departmental cooperation on conflict, stability and security in West Africa.
4.	Technical assistance: We wish to building the capability of HMG staff and our implementing partners (International NGOs, national NGOs, Multilaterals and private sector organisations) to better design, implement and monitor CSSF funded work.
