This programme aims to innovate around the use of smart metering to design, test, manufacture and trial EV chargepoint devices that can perform smart charging in a context beyond the existing smart meter roll out scope. The target contexts for these devices are on-street charging outside the home, and workplace charging. Other contexts will be considered, so long as they are outside the existing smart meter roll out scope which comprises home and microbusiness off-street contexts.  
The programme's aim is to demonstrate that the smart metering system provides a holistic and long-term solution for electric vehicle smart charging, one which can deliver in a range of charging contexts. 

Background
This programme contributes to policy objectives set out in the Government's EV Smart Charging consultation , which outlines the Government's approach and objectives for smart charging of EVs and, seeks evidence on a charging solution. 
The long-term EV smart charging solution needs to meet four policy objectives: grid protection (including cyber security), consumer protection (including interoperability and data privacy), innovation and consumer uptake (of both EVs and smart chargepoints). 
The smart meter system was proposed by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) as the lead option for non-public EV smart charging, based on its established ability to deliver load control in a way which minimises risks to consumers and the wider electricity system. 
Smart metering's current scope extends only to domestic and microbusinesses however, while a long-term solution for smart charging must deliver in a broader range of settings, including public smart charging.  This programme aims to show that smart metering can perform smart charging in a range of contexts outside the current scope. 

Outputs of the programme will include:

Phase 1 Development 
•	Design of a charge point which can operate in the relevant contexts (to be chosen by the service provider) and interface with the smart metering system, acting on load control messages sent via this system. 
•	Manufacture of the device at test scale (10). 
•	Successful testing and issue resolution - demonstration that the device, in simulation conditions, can operate smart EV chargepoints in contexts other than domestic and microbusiness. 

Phase 2 Trial 
•	Trial of the device in the chosen relevant context(s) at scale of ~100 devices.

The Mayor's Police and Crime Plan 2017-21 included a commitment to review the effectiveness of Drug Intervention Programmes (DIP) in London, and that of the current arrangements for drug testing in police custody, to ensure the most effective use of current funds invested in reducing the impact of substance misuse on offending in London.

This review was completed in March 2019, and it has been identified by partners that further work is required to develop a pan-London approach to tackling drugs in London. There are further challenges to implementing the review's recommendations, including the complexity of funding arrangements. 

The London Crime Reduction Board has led the coordination of drugs policy in London over several sessions. The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) are now looking for support to deliver the agreed next steps around DIP and drug treatment in London.

This Invitation to Tender seeks support to map the current funding picture and partnership landscape for offender drug treatment and pathways in London, and to develop and financially model a series of minimum service offers for DIP in London.


Please submit proposals by email to Zoe.Hickman@mopac.london.gov.uk by 17:00hrs on Wednesday 4 March 2020. If you have any questions in relation to this process or tender, these should be submitted via the same email address by 17:00hrs on Wednesday 19 February 2020.

It will play a significant role in promoting and safeguarding the natural, built and cultural heritage at the historic core of Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire.
Miner2Major is delivered by a partnership of organisations that have been active in the Sherwood Forest area for many years. Nottinghamshire County Council is the lead partner and accountable body and will be the commissioning organisation.

The Miner2Major Landscape Partnership area, see Appendix One, covers a region from the northern edge of Nottingham at Bestwood Park, past the eastern edge of Mansfield, to the river Meden between Warsop and Ollerton.  The western edge is defined by a string of towns - Hucknall, Kirkby-in-Ashfield and Mansfield.  The eastern boundary is formed by the A614 and incorporates Rufford Park.
One of the projects being delivered by Miner2Major is called Century of Change. This project will explore the significant change that the Sherwood Forest landscape and society underwent in the period 1850 - 1950 through a series of interlinked Primary school research projects.

To date this programme of works, known as the Wey FWD, has secured mechanisms for the delivery of fish passes from the confluence with the Thames at Weybridge upstream to Westbrook Mill. This opens up fish passage for approximately 100km. However, to secure 'good ecological status', and to ensure that fish are able to reach good quality spawning grounds, the gravel dominated headwaters of the Wey catchment need to be accessible. In addition to this, the quality of the habitat on tributaries and distributaries lower down the catchment also need to be improved. The work proposed under this contract helps to secure both of these objectives through the implementation of two pieces of work, which have been packaged together to secure efficiencies:

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement:

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE Project) is an international collaboration focussed on Neutrino science and Proton decay studies. The experiment consists of a Neutrino Source based at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois; and two Neutrino detectors, one near field (local to the source), and one far field detector based at Sanford Deep Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The Neutrino's travel 1300km through the earth, from the source to the far field detector located 1.5KM below ground level, in a converted mine shaft.

Anode Plane Assemblies (APA) are the building blocks to construct the large far field detector. An APA is a 6M x 2.3M rectangular frame which is wound with a fine Copper beryllium wire mesh and will be used to capture activity caused by passing Neutrino's. Electronics on the frame convert this activity into an electrical signal for measurement and analysis by Physicists.

Further information can be found at: https://www.dunescience.org/

The requirement is for the vendor to build 6 electrical control panels which will operate 6 winding machines used to produce wound APA frames for the DUNE project. 4 of the control panels produced will control winders based at Daresbury Laboratory (DL), whilst the remaining 2 control panels will be shipped to the US to run 2 winders installed at the Physical Sciences laboratory (PSL) in Madison, Wisconsin, US. The winders will produce several hundred APA frames over the coming years.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria set out in the ITQ document.

TEN483,Contract,"CORNWALL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LTD",Awarded,2020-08-02T13:39:59Z,"Towns Fund Coordination - Camborne","The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government published their Prospectus for the Government 'Towns Fund' in November 2019.

This identified that Cornwall Council would be required to take on the role as ""Lead Council"" for the four towns in Cornwall (Penzance, St Ives, Camborne and Truro) that have been selected to participate in the first tranche of 100 towns that are being considered by Government to benefit from up to £25 million each to help their regeneration via a Town Investment Plan.  

The Towns Fund is to drive the economic regeneration of towns to deliver long term economic and productivity growth through: 

•	Urban regeneration, planning and land use
•	Skills and enterprise infrastructure
•	Connectivity

As the ""Lead Council"" for each Town, Cornwall Council is tasked to provide the necessary support to each Town Deal Board to enable them to form and then to successfully develop a dedicated 'Town Investment Plan' (TIP) through local consultation and stakeholder engagement. The TIPs are to be completed and submitted to Government for consideration by the end of 2020.    

A dedicated resource has been allocated by the Council to each of the four Towns  to undertake the functions of Towns Fund co-ordination. 

Camborne's Towns Fund Coordinator role has recently become vacant and a decision has been taken not to replace the Towns Fund Coordinator role, rather to commission the remaining key tasks on a task and finish basis through the engagement of a suitably qualified consultant or consultancy.

The purpose of this Invitation to Tender is therefore to procure the services of a suitably experienced consultant or consultancy to deliver the following scope of work.

Working with the Camborne Town Deal Board to complete the process of developing an appropriate Town Investment Plan in line with Government Guidance. Subject to project/funding agreements, the appointed consultant will also be expected to support the Council/Board/local stakeholders in progressing the delivery of a number of key approved projects.

The commission will include;

•	leading the work required to complete the development of the Camborne Town Investment Plan, including undertaking appropriate community consultation
•	supporting the commissioning by the client of additional external expertise where necessary (e.g. consultation work, building surveys, architect drawings, etc)
•	facilitating negotiations with Cornwall Council, local stakeholders, investors and Government officials regarding the detail of the Town Investment Plan 
•	ensuring that the secretariat functions required to support the work of the Camborne Town Deal Board are delivered in line with the processes outlined in the Board's Terms of Reference (utilising the resources of the Town Hub Support Officer). Please see 
•	supporting the work of the Camborne Town Deal Board through the provision of regular reports and papers for discussion at their meetings",,,"South West","75100000 79410000 79420000 ",,gareth.beer@cornwalldevelopmentcompany.co.uk,"Station Road",,Redruth,TR153QG,England,,,"IIT Towns Fund Coordination (Camborne).pdf Enclosure 1 to TEN483 Camborne Town Deal Board Terms of Reference.docx Enclosure 2 to TEN483 Towns fund guidance.pdf Enclosure 3 to TEN483 CDC Terms and Conditions over 25K.docx CLARIFICATION TO TEN483 DATED 23 JULY 2020.docx ",,,03/08/2020,31/03/2021,29/07/2020,YES,TEN483,Yes,Yes,No,NotSpecified,35000,,31/07/2020,34875,"[Len Smith Consulting|6 Poltisco Wharf

We focus on the problems of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from fundamental science to translation into clinical benefit. We bring together scientists and clinicians to tackle all aspects of AMR. One aspect of our work relates to understanding the molecular mechanisms of AMR. The ability to measure molecular interactions in a quantitative manner will enhance our research capabilities. The ability to measure the strength of interactions is crucial to mechanistic understanding, e.g. between a bacterial protein and an antibiotic.

Our current equipment is a single channel, operator-intensive machine that is suitable for preliminary studies on molecules with a molecular weight of > 10,000 Da. This has become a bottleneck for our studies due to: 1) its low capacity and 2) its inability to detect interactions between small molecules has prompted us to acquire extra capabilities and increased throughput.

This is an non-EU open exercise. The ITT can be downloaded by registering and expressing your interest on the University`s e-tendering system https://in-tendhost.co.uk/Sheffield

The Padiham TH scheme focuses on a compact area of mostly Victorian buildings predominately in retail use on Burnley Rd, an area known locally as 'the hill'.

The area represents a significant cluster of buildings of architectural merit within the Conservation Area, including two listed buildings and a number of locally listed buildings.

The Padiham TH is a five-year scheme totaling approx. £2million which is in its third year of delivery and includes three key strands: Building works - through grant funding available to property owners towards external repair and restoration works such as repairs to roofs, rainwater goods brick/stonework and the reinstatement of architectural detail including windows, doors and traditional shopfronts.

Public realm works - starting in 2020, there will be significant environmental improvements to the town centre including upgrading of paving surfaces, traffic calming measure and decluttering of redundant street furniture.

Community Engagement - Throughout the lifetime of the programme a series of community events/activities will be delivered along with heritage skills training opportunities to engage the local community in heritage and conservation. The TH scheme also includes an Exemplar Project. Led by the Council, this will be a lead-by-example approach in building restoration. The Council has recently acquired a vacant pair of buildings within the TH area which are currently in a poor state of repair, 33-35 Burnley Rd, and wishes to undertake a full repair and restoration scheme to provide two ground floor units for retail use and conversion of the upper floors for residential use. 

The Consultant will be expected to undertake and coordinate all aspects of the scheme, including:
Inspection of the condition of the buildings, undertaking surveying, measuring and coordinating any specialist surveying of the properties that may be required. Preparing plans/drawings including joinery detail and making any amendments as necessary to the planning application made in April 2019 (Ref FULR3/2019/0249). Preparing a full schedule of works/bill of quantities to be priced against. Tendering the works, reviewing of tenders and appointing a suitable contractor/s to undertake the works.
Overseeing the works when on site - supervision, administration, valuations, snagging and sign-off.
To work closely with the Council's Project Team on all aspects of the development and delivery of the scheme.

The value of the contract stated in this notice merely stipulates the Council's anticipated value for this work. This is provided to manage Bidder expectations in terms of funding available for this procurement.

The Good Business Festival, will be engaging with multiple businesses and organisations who will provide content, speakers or a cash investment as a Festival sponsor. 

Each investment level, comes with a set of rights and benefits and Culture Liverpool needs to appoint an organisation (or individual) who can successfully evaluate each contract to deliver a robust sponsorship evaluation to clearly demonstrate return-on-investment

These reports, on each major sponsor, will need to be completed within 28 days of the final event in March 2021, considering all press coverage, digital activity, social engagement, consumer touchpoints, city branding, out-of-home assets, audience attendance (physical and digital) etc plus any additional bespoke agreed content in each partner contract.

The details of each contract will be shared with the agency so a bespoke and accurate report can be produced. 

We, Culture Liverpool, will work alongside our marketing team to provide the appointed agency / individual with digital analytic data and sponsor media/PR generated information to evaluate.

We require the individual reports in a contemporary and professional digital format of outstanding quality, with the rights to share and publish each report. 

Currently we do not have an accurate estimate to give on the number of sponsors that will need to be evaluated, therefore a price per report is requested in order for comparative financial evaluation to take place.",,,"North West","79419000 ","Greg Nixon",greg.nixon@liverpool.gov.uk,"4th Floor, Cunard Building",,Liverpool,"L3 1DS",England,,http://www.liverpool.gov.uk,,,"Please use the messaging function on the ProContract portal

One of the chief goals of the EMPIR project TEMMT - Traceability for electrical measurements at millimetre-wave and terahertz frequencies for communications and electronics technologies - is to develop metrological traceability for power measurements in waveguide in the D-Band, 110 to 170 GHz, thereby improving on the state of the art.

NPL's involvement in this project consists of developing a Micro-calorimeter primary standard and direct comparison transfer systems in this band. NPL is also collaborating on the development and testing of metrology grade power sensors suitable to use in a micro-calorimeter. Two port S-parameter measurements are an essential part of the development characterisation and testing of these standards and systems.

NPL's current VNA capability can access the WR10 W-Band (75 to 110 GHz) and the WR5 G-Band (140 to 220 GHz) for measurement of S-parameters across all of these frequencies, but not at the intervening frequencies. Therefore NPL's current VNA capability requires extending into the WR6 D-Band.

The most effective way to achieve this is for NPL to acquire a pair of WR6 D-Band VNA Extender Heads. These heads are required to be compatible with the Keysight PNA-X, which will be used to drive them.",,"TW11 0LW",London,"38000000 ",,charley.choules@npl.co.uk,"Hampton Road",,Teddington,"TW11 0LW",England,,www.npl.co.uk,,,,28/07/2020,28/07/2021,25/06/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,0,,15/07/2020,95775,"[Virginia Diodes Inc|979 2nd Street S.E.

Scarborough Borough Council's bereavement service are seeking to replace their existing Cemetery and Crematorium management software with a more resilient and robust solution. 

The bereavement service are responsible for approximately 1100 cremations annually with 2 operational cemeteries associated with 236,000 records. The service oversees a series of daily services for cremation, burial plus other services such as strewing.  Duties are carried out at set times throughout the day through organised appointments between the Council and approved Funeral Directors or directly from individuals who do not wish to use a Funeral Director. The service also has the capacity to deal with out of hour's funerals on evenings and weekends through negotiation.

The aims of this project are to provide a reliable and robust solution that increases back office efficiency and provides an improved core back office administration for burials and cremations including memorial records (including memorial safety data) and finance data.  Provide an online booking system for funeral directors

The programme aims to repair and renew (for safety and serviceability reasons) 1000 lane km of concrete roads that are reaching the end of their design life. This scale of concrete renewals is larger than anything Highways England have delivered before.
During the Programme disruption cannot be avoided but Highways England are committed to minimising it. The use of Travel Demand Management (TDM) could help reducing the impact of the proposed roadworks on customers. Highways England is looking to procure consultancy services under the SPaTS Framework to undertake a preliminary study into the feasibility of using TDM strategies and measures, identify suitable TDM options and produce an outline strategy for implementation of the selected options.
Most of the concrete roads are located in the East region and these roads will be the among the first nationally to be repaired or renewed.

Health Education England (HEE - the Commissioner) are putting out this notice as a PIN (Prior Information Notice) with a view to completing a Direct Award. 


Please note the contracting authority intends to direct award the contracts to City University and Kingston University/St. Georges University of London for a short period of time while it determines the authority's commissioning intentions. The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal. 


HEE believe that these universities have the proven academic and technical expertise to support these programmes in 2020/21. To our knowledge they are the only providers of these programmes in London. To test the market HEE had intended to undertake a formal procurement process for these programmes in April 2020 but due to the current national Covid-19 situation this was not appropriate or permissible. 


 


It is envisaged that while the current specifications are underway in 2020/21, an open procurement process will be undertaken for work to be started in 2021 onwards (2-3 years). 


 


The contract period will be a maximum value of £300,000.   


 


For the Specification, Contract and the Case for Direct Award please access the portal at:                                https://procontract.due-north.com/Opportunities/Index?p=40bb618e-0a24-e611-8114-000c29c9ba21&v=2
