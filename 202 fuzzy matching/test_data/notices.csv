This programme aims to innovate around the use of smart metering to design, test, manufacture and trial EV chargepoint devices that can perform smart charging in a context beyond the existing smart meter roll out scope. The target contexts for these devices are on-street charging outside the home, and workplace charging. Other contexts will be considered, so long as they are outside the existing smart meter roll out scope which comprises home and microbusiness off-street contexts.  
The programme's aim is to demonstrate that the smart metering system provides a holistic and long-term solution for electric vehicle smart charging, one which can deliver in a range of charging contexts. 

Background
This programme contributes to policy objectives set out in the Government's EV Smart Charging consultation , which outlines the Government's approach and objectives for smart charging of EVs and, seeks evidence on a charging solution. 
The long-term EV smart charging solution needs to meet four policy objectives: grid protection (including cyber security), consumer protection (including interoperability and data privacy), innovation and consumer uptake (of both EVs and smart chargepoints). 
The smart meter system was proposed by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) as the lead option for non-public EV smart charging, based on its established ability to deliver load control in a way which minimises risks to consumers and the wider electricity system. 
Smart metering's current scope extends only to domestic and microbusinesses however, while a long-term solution for smart charging must deliver in a broader range of settings, including public smart charging.  This programme aims to show that smart metering can perform smart charging in a range of contexts outside the current scope. 

Outputs of the programme will include:

Phase 1 Development 
•	Design of a charge point which can operate in the relevant contexts (to be chosen by the service provider) and interface with the smart metering system, acting on load control messages sent via this system. 
•	Manufacture of the device at test scale (10). 
•	Successful testing and issue resolution - demonstration that the device, in simulation conditions, can operate smart EV chargepoints in contexts other than domestic and microbusiness. 

Phase 2 Trial 
•	Trial of the device in the chosen relevant context(s) at scale of ~100 devices.

tender_239925/885824,Contract,"Defra Network eTendering Portal",Awarded,2020-09-08T11:34:31Z,"Petfished - Partnership Marketing","In August 2018 Defra consulted on a proposal to introduce a ban on third party sales of puppies and kittens in England. This followed a high-profile campaign known as &apos;Lucy Law&apos; which brought attention to the poor welfare conditions associated with pet shops and dealers and the so-called puppy farms that supply them. 

Lucy's Law came into force on 6 April 2020. It means anyone wanting to get a new puppy or kitten in England must now buy direct from a breeder or with one of the nation's reputable rehoming centres. Licensed dog breeders are required to show puppies interacting with their mothers in their place of birth. If a business sells puppies or kittens without a licence, they could receive an unlimited fine or be sent to prison for up to six months. 

On 2 March 2020, ahead of Lucy's Law coming into force, we launched a campaign called Petfished. The term 'Petfished' is a play on 'Catfishing', where a stranger creates a fictional online persona to lure someone in. The campaign raises awareness of unscrupulous sellers so that prospective pet-buyers can buy a cat or dog safely, from a trustworthy source. Urging people to question 'Who's the person behind the pet?' 

The campaign aims to: 

-	Educate our audiences about the risks of buying from an unscrupulous seller 
-	Disrupt the purchasing journey and encourage people to not only research the breed of dog they want but equally to research the seller 
-	Challenge perceptions that low welfare breeders are easy to spot.  

Policy objective: To reduce the demand for puppies and kittens, cats and dogs sold by third parties and supplied by low-welfare and/or illegal breeders.

Communications objectives: The campaign encourages the responsible sourcing of puppies/kittens/cats/dogs by getting buyers/adopters to research the seller before they visit",,,"Any region","79416000 ",,network.procurement@defra.gov.uk,Defra,,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,,"23red - Petfished June 2020 RM3774- Call off contract_Redacted.pdf ",,"

Developing a series of scenarios covering economic and social/behavioural changes arising from COVID-19

Identifying which aspects of water company businesses may be impacted (positively or negatively) in these scenarios, and assessing these impacts on water companies. 

Projecting forward the scenarios and potential impacts on water companies to test the challenges and opportunities to deliver against the PR19 settlement under these scenarios. 

The aim of this work is to understand in what situations water companies would be placed under greater stress due to the impact of COVID-19, what opportunities the new situation might present to them and what the overall effect in each considered scenario would be. This includes both financial elements as well as meeting outcome objectives. It should capture the range of options that water companies have available to them to respond to those scenarios, identify where there may be countervailing benefits or opportunities to companies, and highlight where regulation is a constraint. This work can then be used to understand areas to monitor in the future. 

More detail on each element is provided in the ITT: it is envisaged that the first two elements will need to be carried out in parallel in order to meet the project timeline and for both to contribute to the third element.  

The project will be overseen by an Advisory Group comprising of Ofwat, Water UK and three or four water companies. Each member of the Advisory Group may provide different feedback. It is anticipated that the Supplier will need to manage potential differences in views between Ofwat and Water UK and, where they remain, reflect those differences in the final report. The Supplier is not required to align with the position of either party but to present its own views which may or may not mirror those of the parties.",,,"West Midlands,London","79411000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gov.uk,Birmingham,,Birmingham,B54UA,England,,,,,"For further information,please contact procurement@ofwat.gov.uk",02/07/2020,28/09/2020,26/06/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,117762,,01/07/2020,117762,"[Frontier Economics Limited|Mid City Place

OSMPCS,Contract,"The Mayor's Office of Police and Crime",Awarded,2020-09-03T12:48:54Z,"Offender Substance Misuse Pathways Consultancy Support","The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime is inviting proposals to delivery consultancy support in the development of offender substance misuse pathways.

The Mayor's Police and Crime Plan 2017-21 included a commitment to review the effectiveness of Drug Intervention Programmes (DIP) in London, and that of the current arrangements for drug testing in police custody, to ensure the most effective use of current funds invested in reducing the impact of substance misuse on offending in London.

This review was completed in March 2019, and it has been identified by partners that further work is required to develop a pan-London approach to tackling drugs in London. There are further challenges to implementing the review's recommendations, including the complexity of funding arrangements.

PADRCL,Contract,"The Mayor's Office of Police and Crime",Awarded,2020-09-03T12:45:01Z,"Partnership Approach to Drug-Related Crime in London","The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime is inviting proposals to deliver consultancy support in the development of a partnership approach to tackling drug-related crime in London.

The London Crime Reduction Board (LCRB) has led the coordination of drugs policy in London over several sessions and supported operational partners, such as the Metropolitan Police Service, in its efforts to protect Londoners from harm. We are now looking for support to help develop the next phase of activity to tackle violence and wider harms linked to drugs.

This Invitation to Tender seeks support in two distinct areas. Firstly, by generating an evidence base for understanding the violence, exploitation, and crime patterns linked to drugs, and map the existing activity within City Hall and wider London stakeholders to tackle these issues. There will be a focus on how public spaces are occupied by those involved in the supply of drugs and those associated with drug misuse; and the violence, exploitation, and antisocial behaviour which stems from it, as well as looking at how London partners are responding to this issue. 

This work will use the evidence obtained to develop a theoretical framework for a new strategic approach to tackling the violence, exploitation, and drug-related crime and antisocial behaviour linked to drugs, with the public health ethos at its heart. This will include the development of a London City Hall approach to these issues through future policy and funding interventions.  

Please submit proposals by email to Andrew.Davis@mopac.london.gov.uk by 17:00hrs on Wednesday 4 Marchry 2020. If you have any questions in relation to this process or tender, these should be submitted via the same email address by 17:00hrs on Wednesday 19 February 2020.

tender_243111/884198,Contract,"Department for Education",Awarded,2020-09-02T12:05:09Z,"Urgent Support Services for Vulnerable Children during Covid-19","The intention of this contract is to identify vulnerable children and young people who are hidden from view during Covid-19 and provide frontline assistance and support to them. These are children who are not receiving support currently from statutory agencies; and are at risk of harm and/or experiencing adverse impact to their health and wellbeing due to Covid-19.

The contract will focus on supporting children experiencing or at risk of hidden harm. These are vulnerable children who do not meet the threshold for statutory services and do not have an education, health and care plan or child in need or child protection plan and who are not looked after. These children and young people are being adversely impacted by lockdown.

The purpose of the contract is to prevent their needs escalating so that they do not require more significant interventions either now or at a later date. The group of children that will be identified include those who have experienced or are at risk of serious crimes, young people with disabilities and SEND, children in families experiencing domestic abuse and young couples perpetrating domestic abuse, children experiencing mental health difficulties, trafficked children and homeless families and young people.

As a result of Covid-19 measures, there is a specific need to provide additional services to children who either are, or at risk of, experiencing harm because many of the usual mechanisms for identifying risks have been removed or are experiencing other pressures, for example health visitors, police, community hubs, GPs and schools.

In this instance the events that have led to the extreme urgency are the lockdown which has been a key measure in trying to contain Covid-19 and in conjunction with that the closure of schools, to all but a specified minority of children. Whilst that minority has included 'vulnerable children' (as defined in the DfE Guidance: Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak - actions for educational providers and other partners, updated 15 Mai 2020) not all such children have been in attendance and some children who would not have met the definition of 'vulnerable' at the commencement of the lockdown will have become 'vulnerable' during the lockdown period.",,,"Any region","85300000 ",,beth.lord@education.gov.uk,"St. Paul&apos;s Place",,Sheffield,"S1 2JF",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,31/05/2020,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,7265000,,01/06/2020,7265000,"[Barnardo's|Tanners House, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1QG|NONE_OTHER||No|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,11:59

About UK Shared Business Services 

UK SBS brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise. It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector. Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams. UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It's what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre.

To evidence the value of data for the cohort, as a way of testing if this can be scaled up to other types of interventions.               The data comes in different formats from different systems and quickly becomes too large for current analysis tool to calculate the required formula.

"Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) Second Contract Award",Contract,"Crown Commercial Service",Awarded,2020-08-27T08:37:56Z,"Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) Second Contract Award Notice","The 'Ventilator Challenge' was created by the UK government and delivered across several government departments (Department of Health and Social Care, Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence) as part of the drive to increase ventilator supply and support the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its response to the Coronavirus disease global pandemic (COVID-19).

In March, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad.
The 'Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) programme' is a work stream within the Ventilator Challenge progressing novel and modified designs for ventilator devices, manufactured on a rapid basis to ensure sufficient capacity within the NHS.

Cabinet Office, who are running the RMVS programme on behalf of the UK government, engaged with a wide range of suppliers, including designers, manufacturers and component suppliers, to progress a number of ventilator models (by taking forward existing designs through licencing agreements and by developing new products based on existing products and based on new original designs) resulting in the manufacturer of over 14,000 ventilators to meet the identified need.

A Contract Award Notice was published on 25/05/2020 (reference 2020/S 100-243206) covering contracts awarded pursuant to the RMVS programme. This is a second Contract Award Notice that covers contracts awarded thereafter. This notice also updates the expenditure incurred for contracts relating to Team Consulting, TTP and Cambridge Consultants that were notified in the previous Contract Award Notice. These contracts were awarded on a time and materials basis and therefore additional expenditure was incurred since publication of the previous notice.

For the Smiths Parapac 300, the original contract value was £34,007,542.00. The contract was awarded for 4,418 ventilators, however these volumes were not achieved in the time frames given, therefore the spend to date is £25,500,000.00 (ex. VAT).",,,"United Kingdom","33157000 ","Dan Webster",cco@cabinetoffice.gov.uk,"9th Floor, The Capital Building,","Old Hall Street",Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,"+44 08009981098",https://www.gov.uk/ccs,"Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a call for competition in accordance with Article 32 of Directive 201424EU.pdf ","https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:406004-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML ","Contract 1 - Agreement for the Manufacture and Supply of Ventilators (Smiths ParaPac 300)

The ESN will deliver integrated critical voice and broadband data services to all three emergency services (3ES) and other users throughout GB (England, Wales and Scotland). These services require a mobile communications network capable of providing the full coverage, resilience, security and public safety functionality required by the 3ES. The ESN will replace those services delivered under current service contract(s). A number of these service contracts operate across the 3ES and other users. The new service contracts were awarded during 2015 to facilitate commencement of service delivery from late 2016 as existing service contracts begin to expire. The procurement is divided into 3 Lots with associated Related Projects. \r
\r
This Contract Award Notice is with regard to a Contract awarded to one of the incumbent Suppliers of Control Room systems (as deployed to the UK 3ES customers) to develop a compatible ICCS product upgrade that enables the Supplier's control room ICCS product(s) to interface to ESN. The development is to commence with integration for the minimum subset of Kodiak 9.0, 9.1 and Kodiak 10 features as set out in the Technical Requirements, with a view to subsequently migrating to Kodiak 11 and potentially other future releases as necessary to support the delivery of ESN. \r
\r
The Contract includes the provision of software development services, a proof of concept and testing at a Live End User site, as well as the potential for the provision of ongoing support and maintenance in support of the Supplier's ESN capability.\r

700720368,Contract,"MINISTRY OF DEFENCE",Awarded,2020-08-19T09:40:43Z,"DInfoCom/0125 - Developing the Understanding to Optimise Data Links in Land Information Manoeuvre","There is currently a lack of an effective Tactical Data Link (TDL) in the Land Domain, meaning an insufficient ability to generate, manage and maintain a continuous Recognised Air Picture (RAP).  The TDL capability is central to ensuring dissemination of the RAP and associated tactical information, and secure comms, to all network participants - Maritime, Land and Air.  Without an effective TDL there is an inadequate capability to direct and draw situational awareness (voice and data) from Air, Aviation, Maritime, ISTAR and GBAD into the Land Domain.  There is plenty of agreement that the C2 capabilities delivered by interoperable TDLs are becoming increasingly important to operational commanders. 

The AH 64E and CH47 (ER) are both MOTS FMS 'no white space' projects, fitted with US specification CIS. This has led to interoperability issues with both current UK CIS and future projects. Aviation platforms produce a significant amount of data and currently there is limited CIS that can reconcile that data for Ground FEs. Exploiting TDLs will significantly improve the ability to interoperate with future AH platforms at the tactical level to allow SA, voice and data to be shared between FE's and AH platforms. 

Maximising the data link capabilities in the LD through exploitation of future aviation capabilities, coupled with the use of range extension protocols, such as the Joint Range Extension Applications Protocol (JREAP) through Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) programmes, will allow datalink-fed distributed common operating pictures and C2 down into dismounted situational awareness solutions. This capability significantly increases the effectiveness of Land Information manoeuvre to provide commanders with a cognitive advantage enabled by the virtual domain. 

CIS Interoperability with future AH 64E and the provision of a Recognised Air Picture in the Land Domain are both significant risks that scored highly on Capability Audit 19. A study into the effective use of TDLs will look to feed an option into the next Balance of Investment (BOI). 

Commission a study that will look to capture the network integration challenges and opportunities for datalink-enabled capabilities in the Land Domain. This will enable the development of a coherent strategy to their achievement. The study will specifically look at linkages across Land Forces and between Land and other Joint environments (including multi-national) to enhance Shared Situational Awareness and communications to maximise Land Information Manoeuvre. Although not defining linkages to initiatives including LE TacCIS, ZODIAC and NIOBE specifically, the study will highlight touch points and the challenges and opportunities of such interactions. Cyber vulnerabilities, information assurance and EW-resilience will also be important aspects in terms of evidence for the Cap Audit.",,,"South East","73210000 ",,pauline.hewish662@mod.gov.uk,"D Info Commercial, IDL 1, Blenheim Bldg","HQ Army, Monxton Road",Andover,"SP11 8HJ",England,,,,,,19/08/2020,18/12/2020,30/06/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,51575,,17/08/2020,51575,"[TPG SERVICES LIMITED|Cale House,Station Road

The ESN will deliver integrated critical voice and broadband data services to all three emergency services (3ES) and other users throughout GB (England, Wales and Scotland). These services require a mobile communications network capable of providing the full coverage, resilience, security and public safety functionality required by the 3ES. The ESN will replace those services delivered under current service contract(s). A number of these service contracts operate across the 3ES and other users. The new service contracts were awarded during 2015 to facilitate commencement of service delivery from late 2016 as existing service contracts begin to expire. The procurement is divided into 3 Lots with associated Related Projects. \r
\r
This Contract Award Notice is with regard to a Contract awarded to one of the incumbent Suppliers of Control Room systems (as deployed to the UK 3ES customers) to develop a compatible ICCS product upgrade that enables the Supplier's control room ICCS product(s) to interface to ESN. The development is to commence with integration for the minimum subset of Kodiak 9.0, 9.1 and Kodiak 10 features as set out in the Technical Requirements, with a view to subsequently migrating to Kodiak 11 and potentially other future releases as necessary to support the delivery of ESN. \r
\r
The Contract includes the provision of software development services, a proof of concept and testing at a Live End User site, as well as the potential for the provision of ongoing support and maintenance in support of the Supplier's ESN capability. \r
