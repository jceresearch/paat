ADHD is a mental health disorder and patients will already be destabilised by the Covid-19 pandemic and it would be not within the interest of the patients to cause more anxiety by destabilising the incumbent provider, nor would it be deemed clinically good practice. The direct award enables recovery from the pandemic and stability for the patient's health conditions, with the intention of procuring the service in the future.

The service contract shall be for a period of 18 months and will commence on the 1 September 2020.The contract value is estimated to be £818,000.00 over the 18 month contract period. The prevailing NHS standard contract terms and conditions shall apply.

The service aims to provide a specialist assessment and diagnostic service to adults with a suspected ADHD and those with a confirmed diagnosis residing in Shropshire, Telford, and Wrekin.

Service objectives:
• To enable adults with suspected ADHD who do not have a diagnosed learning disability to obtain a timely diagnosis of their condition;
• To provide a local, weekly clinic, for the review and ongoing treatment of complex and non-complex patients, to include prescribing and monitoring;
• To signpost people with ADHD to other agencies and sources of support as appropriate;
• To provide guidance on self-help strategies and recommendations for patients in support of self-care;
• To signpost patients with an unconfirmed diagnosis to appropriate services and support networks.

The adult specialist ADHD service shall provide a local assessment and diagnosis service to support people with suspected ADHD and those with a diagnosis of ADHD to include prescribing.

The service shall aim to complete an assessment within 18 weeks of receiving a referral for an individual.

The provider shall be required to undertake shared care in relation to prescribing medication with the patient's GP, where the GPs have signed up to the shared care agreement.

A Voluntary Ex Ante Transparency Notice was previously published to support this contract award - 2020/S 142-350894, detailing the following reasons for direct award: 

• A PIN as a call for competition was issued September 2019, four providers expressed interest and were invited through to the tender stage. During the tender stage only two bids were received and one of the bidders provided written withdrawal. This meant only one suitable tender was received. The procurement was aborted.

• This service is deemed an essential service.The current circumstances within the healthcare environment, Covid-19, could negatively affect patients should change happen now. The incumbent provider Health and Wellbeing Ltd is an SME with the requirement to enter into new lease agreements, therefore the CCG's need to ensure ongoing service stability.",,,"West Midlands","85000000 ","Hayley Smith",h.smith27@nhs.net,"NHS Telford and Wrekin CCG","Halesfield 6, Halesfield",Telford,"TF7 4BF",England,07770493216,,"ADHD VEAT 2020-OJS142-350894-en.pdf ",,"A VEAT Notice was published under the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

Brief Description of Requirement

The provision of 5 x Hospital Transport Electronic Vital Sign Monitors.

This process can be a protracted affair that can involve treatment, medication, monitoring and basic life support through transportation to end point. To fulfil this need BASMU requires robust, multifunctional equipment, that provides sufficient information to inform remote diagnostics and support by specialists until patients can be transferred to hospital.

2574/JS,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD",Awarded,2020-09-07T09:11:35Z,"Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine capable of high throughput digital PCR and qPCR","The University of Sheffield is out to tender on behalf of the Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease for a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine capable of high throughput digital PCR and qPCR. The Florey Institute within the University of Sheffield takes an interdisciplinary approach to anti-microbial resistance (AMR) and host-pathogen interaction research. The Institute is comprised of scientists and clinicians who work closely with the Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Trust (STH) to deliver high-impact fundamental and translational research outputs.

We require an automated, high-throughput PCR machine to aid our gene expression studies. One of our research focuses involves measuring host gene expression changes in response to infection and this requires the measurement of large numbers of selected genes by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and/or real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on thousands of patient samples. In addition to this work, we also aim to use digital PCR to detect pathogens present at low copy number in patient and environmental samples.


Initially the equipment may be housed in one in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital laboratories due to the pandemic (not all University laboratories are currently open and we may need to minimise staff movement between laboratories). It would therefore be an advantage if the machine could be moved to a different location at the University at a later date. It was originally intended to be housed in the NERC Biomolecular Facility and may still move there dependent on future discussions about space.

The full technical specification can be found in the tender documentation which will be sent to you once you have expressed your interest. 


Tender Process and Documentation:

This is a E.U. open exercise. The ITT can be downloaded by registering and expressing your interest on the University`s e-tendering system https://in-tendhost.co.uk/Sheffield.

If you have any questions or comments in relation to this tender they must be submitted via the In-tend System, this can be accessed at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/Sheffield

Completed tenders must be returned through the same e-tendering system.

Closing date for receipt of tenders: Monday 6th July 2020 at 12:00 noon (UK time).

The programme, which runs from December 2019 to December 2022, will support at least sixty businesses through grants and specialist business support whilst leveraging £1,375,639 of match funding from the private sector. It aims to;

•	Increase the performance and competitiveness of local enterprises, create highly skilled jobs and launch new products into the marketplace

•	Develop the 'innovation ecosystem' for the space and aerospace clusters by incentivising local businesses to collaborate with other businesses and research institutions to accelerate their innovation. 

•	Increase the value and capability of the local space and aerospace clusters and secure ongoing investment in them. 

AeroSpace Cornwall also supports inward investors by awarding soft landing packages and investment incentives, with the aim of encouraging collaboration with other businesses across Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 
AeroSpace Cornwall works closely with other programmes (for example Cornwall Trade and Investment and Spaceport Cornwall) to ensure businesses experience a 'joined up' approach to support and funding and to ensure the overall messaging about Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly is aligned. 
AeroSpace Cornwall works with manufacturing and engineering businesses who are, or aspire to be, part of the space / aerospace supply chains and digital businesses such as those developing software applications in the satellite communications, earth observation, navigation and meteorology areas.

Cornwall Development Company is seeking to commission a single contractor to carry out the following evaluations for the AeroSpace Cornwall programme; 
•	A baseline evaluation - Completed by December 2020 

This phase will include the creation of a Summative Assessment Plan by September 2020, evaluation of the processes involved in delivering the Programme and capture of baseline evidence for the 'Project Context' for the Summative Assessment Final Report. See guidance via link below;

•	An interim evaluation - Completed by September 2021

The aim of the interim evaluation focuses on gathering evidence of 'Project Progress' for the Summative Assessment Final Report and evaluates progress against the Summative Assessment Plan. The interim evaluation should include the outputs achieved to date and make suggestions for further improvements which can be incorporated within delivery for the final twelve months of the programme.

•	Final evaluation - Delivered by July 2022

The final evaluation should provide evidence for 'Outcomes and Impact, Value for Money, Conclusions and Lessons Learnt' for the Summative Assessment Final report and evaluate gross and net additional impact.

To evidence the value of data for the cohort, as a way of testing if this can be scaled up to other types of interventions.

"Manufacturing Sector Notice - 310720",Contract,"CORNWALL MARINE NETWORK LIMITED",Awarded,2020-08-26T17:14:36Z,"Manufacturing Sector - Employer Led Skills Support","Cornwall Marine Network (CMN) has secured project funding through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), known locally as the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Growth Programme, from the European Union's European Social Fund for a project named Employer Led Skills (ELS) and is seeking to procure a new sub-contractor to deliver some aspects of the project in the Manufacturing sector.

One of the dominant contributory factors to the region's productivity and economic growth is the level of education, training and skills within the working age population. The attached Invitation to Tender seeks to address a range of issues concerning the development and upskilling of the Manufacturing workforce. It aims to help businesses to develop and grow, become more resilient and more productive. 

There are approximately 1,300 Manufacturing units in C&IoS who employ around 15,500 (2017 data), this reflects a 16% reduction between 2012-2017. Overall, the wider Manufacturing sector accounts for almost 10% of the total workforce which is consistent with the GVA figures below.

The Manufacturing sector delivers almost £800m to the economy but by addressing low productivity this contribution could increase rapidly. Manufacturing experienced the highest sectoral growth in GVA per job from 2012-2017 at 24%. 

It is important for applicants to ensure that proposals do not duplicate existing activities or activities that do not address market failure. ESF can only be used to achieve additional activity or bring forward activity more quickly. Applicants must be able to demonstrate that proposals are additional to activity that would have occurred anyway and/or enables activity to be brought forward and delivered more quickly than otherwise would be the case in response to the demand established by sectoral development work and needs analysis.

In order to address the issue that productivity across the sector lags behind that of England and the EU we need a focused programme of support in the Manufacturing sector to drive up growth in knowledge and skills and as such CMN expects to allocate up to £85,000 of ESF, inclusive of VAT, to support 300 participants to gain a range of new skills and qualifications.

To achieve this applicants will be required to establish a sector led skills development programme which will address the four key themes identified through the ESF Developing Skills for Business project as critical to the sector's sustainability and growth. The four themes are:
•	Continuous Improvement
•	Leadership/Management
•	Train the Trainer
•	Supply Chain & Procurement

Applicants will be responsible for securing eligible match funding for the balance of costs in their proposed delivery models.",,,"South West","80000000 ","Mark Williams",mark.williams@cornwallmarine.net,"Unit 7A,Falmouth Business Park Bickland Water Road",,FALMOUTH,TR114SZ,England,"01326 211382",www.cornwallmarine.net,"ELS manufacturing procurement template scoring criteria.xlsx ELS Manufacturing Sector Invitation to Tender.docx ELS manufacturing procurement Q&A.docx ELS manufacturing procurement Q&A 110820.docx ",,"Please ensure that you address all of the questions and points outlined in the specification, including the cross cutting themes of equality, diversity and sustainability.",01/09/2020,31/03/2023,14/08/2020,NO,,Yes,No,Yes,Services,85000,,26/08/2020,95656,"[Cornwall Manufacturers Group|Chy Nyverow

700720368,Contract,"MINISTRY OF DEFENCE",Awarded,2020-08-19T09:40:43Z,"DInfoCom/0125 - Developing the Understanding to Optimise Data Links in Land Information Manoeuvre","There is currently a lack of an effective Tactical Data Link (TDL) in the Land Domain, meaning an insufficient ability to generate, manage and maintain a continuous Recognised Air Picture (RAP).  The TDL capability is central to ensuring dissemination of the RAP and associated tactical information, and secure comms, to all network participants - Maritime, Land and Air.  Without an effective TDL there is an inadequate capability to direct and draw situational awareness (voice and data) from Air, Aviation, Maritime, ISTAR and GBAD into the Land Domain.  There is plenty of agreement that the C2 capabilities delivered by interoperable TDLs are becoming increasingly important to operational commanders. 

The AH 64E and CH47 (ER) are both MOTS FMS 'no white space' projects, fitted with US specification CIS. This has led to interoperability issues with both current UK CIS and future projects. Aviation platforms produce a significant amount of data and currently there is limited CIS that can reconcile that data for Ground FEs. Exploiting TDLs will significantly improve the ability to interoperate with future AH platforms at the tactical level to allow SA, voice and data to be shared between FE's and AH platforms. 

Maximising the data link capabilities in the LD through exploitation of future aviation capabilities, coupled with the use of range extension protocols, such as the Joint Range Extension Applications Protocol (JREAP) through Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) programmes, will allow datalink-fed distributed common operating pictures and C2 down into dismounted situational awareness solutions. This capability significantly increases the effectiveness of Land Information manoeuvre to provide commanders with a cognitive advantage enabled by the virtual domain. 

CIS Interoperability with future AH 64E and the provision of a Recognised Air Picture in the Land Domain are both significant risks that scored highly on Capability Audit 19. A study into the effective use of TDLs will look to feed an option into the next Balance of Investment (BOI). 

Commission a study that will look to capture the network integration challenges and opportunities for datalink-enabled capabilities in the Land Domain. This will enable the development of a coherent strategy to their achievement.

"P/REF HE 00001420 - AWARD",Contract,"Historic England",Awarded,2020-08-18T17:29:24Z,"8351 Design in the historic environment  - AWARD","England's cities, towns, and countryside are the products of change over a long period of time.  The heritage values of these places - historic street patterns, the development of vernacular building styles and the use of traditional construction materials, as well as the fieldscapes that surround us - are the most visible elements of this on-going process of change and the goal is to ensure that the historic environment continues to make a positive contribution to the future form and character of places. 
      
      Historic England already provides a suite of practical help and guidance designed to encourage improved and appropriate development and regeneration in historic environments .  These are available on the Historic England website: other supporting documentation is available via Historic England Advice Notes and related guidance . Key documents include: Historic England's Place-making strategy ; the setting of historic assets ; advice on Tall Buildings ; Understanding Place ; Building in Context ; and Streets for All . It is absolutely essential that our work and guidance reflects and responds to any changes to the planning system and must reference more recent policy and design guidance (e.g. the National Design Guide) to help frame emerging planning policy and assess its impacts on historic assets and places.  This commissioned project will use specialist design consultants to, where necessary, update our design-related guidance and unite it as a single 'design offer',  making sure it reflects recent (and progressing) developments in government policy, and so that it can be presented on a single section of the Historic England's website. 
      
      The project's products should be usable by all those with an interest in design quality in historic places such as landowners, developers and planners, as well as individuals and communities. This project should:
      - facilitate a better understanding of the vulnerability, significance and value of the historic environment
      - support the protection and enhancement of surviving fabric and character in the light of the pressures and opportunities that flow from development and other, related, scenarios
      - result in beneficial and sustainable outcomes for the historic environment, including through improving the design of change
      
      The products of the project will be material to be used on Historic England's website and in related training events. Historic England is aware of a wide range of construction and design 'apps' currently available and, with this is mind, we are keen to explore innovative options for how we might capture and present the data in a digital, potentially interactive, environment, e.g. providing an immersive experience for a user to interact with the design process such as makeover for a building using different materials, or window to wall ratios, or similar. 
      
      The outcomes from this project will be used within Historic England to frame and develop a Historic ...",,"SN2 2EH","Any region","73000000 ","Charlie Garratt",HPCPTenders@HistoricEngland.org.uk,"The Engine House","Firefly Avenue",SWINDON,"SN2 2EH","United Kingdom",02073942987,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/historic-england/aspx/Home,,,,13/08/2020,29/10/2020,06/08/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,20000,25000,18/08/2020,20738,"[Purcell|15 Bermondsey Square, Tower Bridge Road, London, London, United Kingdom, SE1 3UN|NONE||No|No]","Sarah  Park",13/08/2020,29/10/2020,"Open ",,17:00

The service will include provision for adults and children. 

It will also include an ISVA based in the Sexual Assault Referral Centre.
NHS England is working in partnership with the Bedfordshire Police to deliver a Sexual Violence Support Service for all who require the service. 
This collaboration is between:
• The Police and Crime Commissioner for Bedfordshire
• NHS England & NHS Improvement (East of England)

As a victim focused service the delivery of quality is paramount to a successful partnership. This tender deals with some of the most vulnerable people in Health and Justice.

The successful bidder, will at all time, treat the people seen in the upmost dignified manner and respect.

There are significant challenges in commissioning services for victims and survivors of sexual violence setting both financial and cross organisational involving a complex process of working across pathways and at times conflicting priorities. It is important that where possible these priorities accommodate a shared understanding of opportunities for quality and value and a shared approach to the management of provider performance

SP/20/1161,Contract,"Lancaster University",Awarded,2020-08-12T13:42:22Z,"Gas Sub Duct Infrastructure Project","The University is inviting tenders on the terms set out in the ITT.
The Spine Service Duct at Lancaster University was originally constructed in the mid 1960's and contains multiple services to facilitate interconnecting buildings. The Main Duct is approximately 1 kilometre long, and is sub divided into two equal halves, North & South. The Duct is also a designated confined space. The Main Duct interlocks with approximately 20 No. sub ducts, each sub duct forms a service entry into the associated buildings. The Duct system equates to approximately 2100 metres in total.   The University commissioned a DSEAR risk assessment, and subsequently the Natural Gas Infrastructure is undergoing a replacement/upgrade programme. 
This project involves the replacement of RAG rated aging gas infrastructure with stainless steel gas pipework and fittings, located within the sub ducts.  The majority of the works is located in a designated confined space, and as such the contractor will have to be fully aware of the restrictions and constraints that this will put upon the project.  
The University is adopting a phased approach ensuring the Spine Duct and sub ducts continue to be compliant with legislation. Further work packages will be developed for future phases. 

The location of the site is Bailrigg Campus, Lancaster, LA1 4YW.

This tender is not lotted. One contractor will be awarded the full package of work.

The University will host an accompanied site visit on Monday 27th July 2020 . Please register your intention to attend via the In-Tend 'correspondence' function by 10am Friday 24th July 2020 as you will be allocated a time slot.  The University will only host site visits on Monday 27th July 2020 as a Confined Spaces Rescue team will be in attendance on that day only.

      The main scope of this scheme is to provide central heating upgrading, wet room conversion and improved fire safety measures within each of the bungalows. The communal area is only having the heating upgrade works.
      Currently, heating and hot water is supplied to each bungalow on a communal system provided from a central boiler house, located on the site. Due to the age and general condition of the boiler it is proposed for each bungalow to have its own independently controlled heating system installed in the form of a gas combi-boiler. The appointed contractor will be charged with the isolation and capping-off of the existing heating system at each bungalow within the programme of works.
      Please note that the de-commissioning of the boiler house will not form part of this project and is to be undertaken by the authority's facilities management contractor.
      Existing shower areas are to be altered and a full wetroom conversion is to be undertaken to standard designs across all bungalows. This will involve the installation of a new shower, wash hand basin and w/c complete to improve and standardise the facility for all bungalows.
      To improve the fire safety aspects of the dwelling the installation of a new multi-sensor alarm system is to be installed and fire-stopping implemented throughout as per the requested fire compartmentation survey which the appointed contractor is to arrange and oversee as part of the project.
      It is estimated that a start on site is achievable during August 2019 and that completion of the scheme should be achieved within a 12 week programme.
      The tenant needs and requirements are paramount to the successful completion of this project. The successful contractor will be expected to show flexibility, excellence in tenant support / liaison and work in partnership with the Contract Administrator / Building Surveyor to meet and exceed tenant expectation and levels of satisfaction.",,"S43 4JY","Any region","45453100 ","Joan Talbot",joan.talbot@bolsover.gov.uk,"High Street",Clowne,Derbyshire,"S43 4JY","United Kingdom","01246 242582",,,,,01/08/2019,31/10/2019,01/07/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,0,,06/08/2020,151133.17,"[Matthews and Tannert Ltd|Bannerman Road, Kirkby in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom, NG17 8DU|NONE||No|No]","Kelly Ramsdale",01/08/2019,31/10/2019,"Open ",
