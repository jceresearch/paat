These tools will be used to inform policy decisions and prioritise funding to vulnerable businesses, sectors or geographies, and monitor business closures and impacts in near real-time.
Successful delivery of this research and tooling will require the following analytical capabilities:

1.	Application of machine learning across alternative data sources to forecast and monitor the impact of Covid-19 across business and industry by sector and geography
2.	Simulation to estimate likely future impact of Covid-19 across business and industry
3.	Development of interactive applications/dashboards which summarise the above monitoring and forecasting activities into an easily consumable interface to inform policy-makers

At present a cross-functional team from within BEIS is being assembled from experts in the Economics and Data Science practices. Faculty is proposing to support the BEIS internal team with a high-performing group of data scientists, engineers and UI/UX designers to work directly alongside BEIS to deliver these capabilities.
The intention is for this to work as a single team, working in a highly agile and iterative way; potentially shifting towards clearer work streams or deliverables as the user requirements sharpen in focus.

Over the next five years, based on current scientific programmes, the UK Biobank resource will grow to approximately 15 Petabytes of data.

Full details of the services required are included within the specification. This Specification sets out UK Biobank's requirements for the initial provision of such a Platform, including:

      Advanced manufacturing is a key research priority area for Nottingham and the University has invested significantly in this research. The University made a strategic investment in automated assembly infrastructure through the Future Automated Aerospace Assembly Demonstrator (FA3D) project, which was commissioned in 2016. Based on the success of this project, funding has been secured from the UK Government's Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) through the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) for development of the second phase of this demonstrator. 
      The Future Automated Aerospace Assembly Demonstrator Phase 2 (FA3D2) will deliver a national experimental testbed and technology demonstrator in digital and informatics enabled aerospace manufacturing technology. It provides an opportunity for UK based aerospace manufacturing businesses to test, demonstrate and accelerate the implementation of novel breakthrough technologies, thus allowing them to compete on productivity, quality and cost with rival offshore businesses.
      The demonstrator aims to reduce the non-recurring costs of a product line by implementing a flexible assembly approach. A key feature of the FA3D2 platform will be its flexibility to be reconfigured for different products and assembly processes. This applies to both the physical reconfiguration of equipment and tooling, and also the digital integration architecture. The platform shall be designed to be extensible such that tooling, end effectors, robots etc. may be added in future with minimal disruption to the existing system i.e. a 'plug and produce' approach.",,"NG7 2RN","Any region","42990000 48800000 51500000 42997300 ","Leanne Bryant",bbzlsb@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk,"Lenton Lane",Nottingham,Nottinghamshire,"NG7 2RN","United Kingdom",01159513635,,,,,01/01/2020,01/01/2021,01/11/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,1260000,2270000,15/06/2020,135693,"[N.T.I MEASURE|GENABUL PARK / BAT.

The 'Fibroscan' is now the gold standard method to assess the degree of liver fibrosis in patients without the need for a biopsy and is used in clinical practice guidelines (including NICE) for many disorders such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In recent years, the number of patients being seen in the liver clinic with NAFLD has increased dramatically. This is most commonly related to being overweight. Patients with NAFLD are not only at risk of developing liver fibrosis but also are at risk of heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. The new Fibroscan machines are able to measure the amount of fat within the liver with the CAP score (controlled attenuation parameter) to diagnose this without the need for biopsy. The standard 'M-probe' that the Fibroscan uses is often unable to take an accurate reading in patients who are very overweight. In these cases, the new 'XL-probe' is required to take the Fibroscan measurements.

The Council is on track to deliver 1,850 new affordable homes by 2023 with sites for a further potential 2,000 new homes identified. The delivery of these homes involves complex regeneration schemes at Ebury Bridge Estate and Church Street, as well as sensitive infill and prominent high- profile sites across the city. The delivery of these homes will depend on a range of delivery solutions including partnerships with development and investment partners and self-delivery. The Council&apos;s newly formed wholly owned development company also offers a route for funding, delivering and owning new intermediate rent, market rent and sale housing across the borough.

The Ebury Bridge Estate renewal project is the most strategically important of all these developments. Ebury is located in the South-West of the borough, close to the mainline Victoria Station. Railway tracks to Victoria act as a physical barrier to the East of the estate and the Belgravia neighbourhood is to the West. The estate has excellent connectivity and offers a tremendous opportunity for a prestigious, exemplar estate renewal opportunity in Central London.

The Council has made significant investment over recent years developing a high- quality exciting scheme in consultation with local residents and approved the full demolition and re-provision of the estate in July 2018. The Council has established an experienced team and in March 2019 committed to and approved the self-delivery (Council as Employer) of an initial phase comprising two residential blocks providing over 200 new, mixed tenure homes and the first of the new open public squares, setting the design quality and delivery intentions for the new Ebury. This initial phase will enable the Council to fulfil their re-housing commitments locally and achieve vacant possession of later phases. Ebury sits at the heart of the Council&apos;s City for All intention and we are now seeking suitable partners to help us deliver and achieve these aspirations.

The Council is seeking a suitable and appropriately qualified Design & Build partner to deliver the programme which is currently phased, with phase 1 aiming to start on site at the end of 2020. The estimated construction value of the requirement is currently valued between £97m-350 m (Phase 1 - all phases). All amounts are subject to indexation and the procurement contracts make provision for changes which mean the procurement value may be increased beyond the range included in this notice, changes will be in accordance with regulation 72 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

In Phase 1 the Council will be the successful Tenderer&apos;s employer and the Council will self-fund the cost of construction. However, the Council reserves its right to amend the structure and funding plans in relation to Phase 2, including but not limited to appointing a third party employer.",,"SW1E 6QP",London,"45000000 ","Westminster City Council",tenders@westminster.gov.uk,"64 Victoria Street",,London,"SW1E 6QP",England,,,,,,26/06/2020,31/03/2026,06/03/2020,NO,,No,No,No,Works,350000000,,26/06/2020,350000000,"[Bouygues UK Limited|London|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,26/06/2020,31/03/2026,"CompetitiveProcedureWithNegotiationOJEU ",

Raw material for mRNA vaccine development/manufacture of a COVID 19 vaccine. This is a fast moving and time limited project. As a synthetically expressed mRNA vaccine, a DNA template is required for expression and manufacture. The DNA template design is the key IP and any transfer to 3rd party manufacturing sites needs to be protected with relevant MTA agreements. The DNA template can be manufactured in a couple of different ways, either using E. Coli to make conventional plasmid DNA template which then needs to be purified, or using a unique synthetic manufacturing route developed by the supplier to make a DNA template called ""Doggy Bone DNA"" dbDNA. The supplier already have an MTA with the research company and have manufactured dbDNA in stock and ready for dispatch, any other supplier will need to negotiate an MTA with the research company and then develop a manufacturing process before being able to manufacture a product for sale. This process will take several months and cause a significant delay to the process development activities at CPI.  The manufacturing process is unique to the supplier, fully validated and scalable and is able to supply any quantity of DNA required.

The organisation is embarking on a new strategy for the 2020's and an ambitious programme to transform the way in which we serve our customers. Although these contracts adequately support the delivery of current operational services, the organisation needs a new strategic technology partner to meet its changing needs for the 2020's.

As a result, FSCS is looking at evolving the way to source and deliver its IT services. Our aim is to secure a strategic technology partner. 

FSCS currently performs a range of functions in-house, as well as those currently outsourced. FSCS' aim, over the life of the contract, is to develop the right mix of services to be performed either in-house or to be outsourced to a partner. In determining the most appropriate approach, it will be necessary to accommodate:

- FSCS' ambition to exploit the benefits of a cloud-based environment,

- the potential replacement of our FSCS main claims technology platforms as part of our ongoing service transformation,

- FSCS' desire to embrace, where appropriate, new innovative technologies.
 
Potential service providers should note that this procurement is not looking to simply re-let the existing contracts but is looking for a long term 'Strategic Partner' who can support FSCS to fulfil the CIO Strategy for the future.

The scope of the services is split into 3 areas: foundation services, transformation services and future services.

Foundation services:
FSCS requires several services to be in place, or to be available, from the start of the contract. This includes:

- strategic partnership,
- software development lifecycle,
- personnel - time and materials,
- hardware and software,
- microsoft azure and office 365 Support.

Transformation services:
In order to deliver FSCS' strategic vision we recognise there are areas of our technology that require transformation. We expect the transformation to start when the contract starts, and the initial phases to be costed, but for each subsequent phase to be agreed and costed as we move through the transformation. This includes:
- selection, implementation and support of claims platform
- cloud assessment, migration and support.

Future services:

Future services are areas of technology provision that might be moved into this contract over time but would be agreed on a case by case basis. We have laid out the potential scope of these services, so suppliers have an upfront view of what additional services might be available over the life of the contract. This includes but not limited to:

- IT service functions,
- support for finance solutions,
- infrastructure services,
- service desk/ITSM tooling.",,,"United Kingdom,Isle of Man,Channel Islands","72000000 ","Chris Sutherland",Procurement@fscs.org.uk,"10th Floor, Beaufort House","15 St. Botolph Street",LONDON,"EC3A 7QU",England,"0207 375 8194",,,"https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:305297-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML ","There will be an option for FSCS to extend the contract on 2 occasions for a maximum duration of 12 months on each of those occasions, therefore making the effective service term a potential total term of 7 years.

The contract value is an estimate based on the duration including extension options.

(UK Ordnance Survey grid reference SX 93217 89154). At present, this section of the A379 is a 4-lane single carriageway with limited facilities for pedestrians/cyclists. There are no crossing facilities near the Sannerville Way roundabout and a narrow shared use path on the south side of this road. The proposal seeks to introduce a new toucan crossing on the approach to the Sannerville Way roundabout to connect the south side of the A379 with the existing shared use path on Bridge Road and Matford Marsh. The existing shared use path on the A379 will also be widened where possible. Furthermore, a new signalised junction will be created with a new side road to the south of the A379 which will provide access to the proposed development area. The elements of work included in this phase of the scheme are, but not limited to: • Site Clearance • Earthworks • Drainage Works • Introduction of a staggered toucan crossing. • Modification and widening, where possible, of the existing shared use paths. • Realignment of the carriageway. • Resurfacing of the carriageway. • Road markings and signage. • Introduction of a new signalised junction. • Introduction of a new side road with shared paths and a staggered toucan crossing. • Removal of a layby. • Vehicle Restraint System Barriers • Street lighting electrical works. • Landscaping works.

A feasibility study of five sites was carried out by Calford Seaden with specialist input provided by ICAX on the hydrogeological assessment side. As a result of the feasibility, two sites have been discounted leaving three that were deemed technically and financially viable - Consort, Newington and Wyndham.

All main contractors on Lot 3 of the framework were invited to attend an information day and site visit in September, which included some background information on the project at that stage and the chance to see an aquifer based water source heat pump in action at the London South Bank University.

We would like to build this set-up using an inverted motorised microscope body with very high flexibility, equipped with high-numerical aperture objective (to study at high resolution), an auto-focus system (allows long time experiment without any drift) and an automated stage (to image image multiple regions of the samples). 

To compliment the Compound Microscope multiple lasers (4 different colours) and a highly sensitive camera will be purchased separately and added by the University. 

In the near future we will add new optical modules in such a way that we can do label free imaging of single proteins.

It is WMCA&apos;s intention that contracts awarded will initially be awarded for 15 months (academic year 2019 to 2020), with an option to extend for a further year up to July 2022. The value of the contract extension is still to be confirmed.

 Lot Structure
 WMCA has split this procurement activity into three Lots:

 Lot 4 - Support for those in Employment 
 Lot 4 includes:
 - Focus on new learning to support career progression
 - A flexible adult offer to enable those who seek to re-train and up-skill 
 - Particular focus but not exclusive to those in low-paid, low-skilled and insecure jobs
 - Level 2, 3 and 4
 - Funding subsidies available to support L3 and L4
 - Pre-apprenticeship provision that supports uptake of Apprenticeships 

 Lot 5 - Birmingham Commonwealth Games 
 Lot 5 includes:
 - Particular focus on young people aged between 19 and 30 and unemployed adults aged 30+ through level 3 provision
 - Technical skills at level 3 supporting event management, digital marketing, hospitality, sports coaching and team leading. 

 Lot 6 - Coventry City of Culture 
 Focus on creative, digital and tourism to prepare those individuals not working in the city least likely to have the skills, confidence or access to the programmes the city of culture trust, will be running (including volunteering, apprenticeships and events-based jobs). The development delivered through these programmes should move individual to the point where they are able to access and compete for opportunities created as a result of the City of Culture.
 One of the potential outcomes that individuals may be prepared to access is the ""city hosts"" programme - a crew of 5,000 individuals trained to provide the best possible welcome to the city for visitors. This, alongside apprenticeships and events related jobs in hospitality, production, sales, customer service, event management, security and tourism sectors are the type of opportunities that people should be supported to access.

 Bidders can submit proposals for as many lots as they wish. For completeness, it should be noted that the lots in this tender opportunity are listed from 4 - 6. The reason for the lot numbering is to follow on from the award of lots 1-3 from the first AEB tender round that was undertaken in 2019.",,,"West Midlands","80000000 ","West Midlands Combined Authority",procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/07/2021,06/03/2020,YES,tender_230215/831583,Yes,Yes,No,Services,189000,,18/06/2020,4000000,"[WALTHAM INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE LIMITED|Floor 7 Crown House, Linton Road, Barking, Essex, IG11 8HG|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Babington Business College Limited|Babington House, Mallard Way, Pullman Business Park, Pride Park, Derby DE24 8GX|NONE_OTHER||No|No][PET-Xi Training Limited|Unit 4, Westwood House, Westwood Business Park, Coventry, CV4 8HS|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/07/2021,"OpenOJEU ",
