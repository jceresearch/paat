Developing a series of scenarios covering economic and social/behavioural changes arising from COVID-19

Identifying which aspects of water company businesses may be impacted (positively or negatively) in these scenarios, and assessing these impacts on water companies. 

Projecting forward the scenarios and potential impacts on water companies to test the challenges and opportunities to deliver against the PR19 settlement under these scenarios. 

The aim of this work is to understand in what situations water companies would be placed under greater stress due to the impact of COVID-19, what opportunities the new situation might present to them and what the overall effect in each considered scenario would be. This includes both financial elements as well as meeting outcome objectives. It should capture the range of options that water companies have available to them to respond to those scenarios, identify where there may be countervailing benefits or opportunities to companies, and highlight where regulation is a constraint. This work can then be used to understand areas to monitor in the future. 

More detail on each element is provided in the ITT: it is envisaged that the first two elements will need to be carried out in parallel in order to meet the project timeline and for both to contribute to the third element.  

The project will be overseen by an Advisory Group comprising of Ofwat, Water UK and three or four water companies. Each member of the Advisory Group may provide different feedback. It is anticipated that the Supplier will need to manage potential differences in views between Ofwat and Water UK and, where they remain, reflect those differences in the final report. The Supplier is not required to align with the position of either party but to present its own views which may or may not mirror those of the parties.",,,"West Midlands,London","79411000 ",,mailbox@ofwat.gov.uk,Birmingham,,Birmingham,B54UA,England,,,,,"For further information,please contact procurement@ofwat.gov.uk",02/07/2020,28/09/2020,26/06/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,117762,,01/07/2020,117762,"[Frontier Economics Limited|Mid City Place

This award was made under BEIS Research & Evaluation Framework CR150025 - LOT3

The Department for International Development (DFID), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome jointly fund the Health Systems Research Initiative (HSRI). All the funders are committed to supporting world-class research with high potential for impact on policy and practice.
Launched in 2013 this programme aims to generate world class and cutting-edge research that addresses key questions on strengthening and improving health systems in developing countries. 
The programme's aims are to fund methodologically rigorous, high quality research that will:
1.	Generate evidence on how to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
2.	Use a health systems approach to inform the delivery of evidence-based interventions or health system reforms. 
3.	Provide evidence that is of direct relevance to decision makers and practitioners in the field.
4.	Engender capacity development in health policy and systems research amongst both research users and producers of evidence.
There have so far been six annual calls for proposals under the HSRI. Typically, around £5million is available for funding proposals per year. Innovative proposals are sought from across the public health, social and biomedical sciences and must clearly identify what health system challenge is being addressed. 

The objectives of the review are:
-	To provide information on whether and how the scheme delivers on its core aim of generating high quality, internationally competitive research which addresses key questions on strengthening and improving health systems in LMICs
-	To investigate whether there are outcomes and impacts from research funded by the scheme; to explore and describe what barriers and facilitators there are to achieving impact, and how future impact can be maximised.
-	To provide the funders with case studies representative of the work funded under the scheme that can be used to demonstrate the range of outcomes and impact.
-	To provide guidance to the funders on future monitoring, evaluation and learning for the scheme.
-	As part of the evaluation the funders would welcome a review and update of the Theory of Change for the scheme",,,"South West","73000000 79300000 ","Karl Oakley",Research@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House","North Star House",SWINDON,SN21FF,England,"01793 867000",,,,,06/07/2020,31/03/2021,07/05/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,0,160000,01/07/2020,150475,"[TECHNOPOLIS LIMITED|2-3 Pavilion Buildings

One of the chief goals of the EMPIR project TEMMT - Traceability for electrical measurements at millimetre-wave and terahertz frequencies for communications and electronics technologies - is to develop metrological traceability for power measurements in waveguide in the D-Band, 110 to 170 GHz, thereby improving on the state of the art.

NPL's involvement in this project consists of developing a Micro-calorimeter primary standard and direct comparison transfer systems in this band. NPL is also collaborating on the development and testing of metrology grade power sensors suitable to use in a micro-calorimeter. Two port S-parameter measurements are an essential part of the development characterisation and testing of these standards and systems.

NPL's current VNA capability can access the WR10 W-Band (75 to 110 GHz) and the WR5 G-Band (140 to 220 GHz) for measurement of S-parameters across all of these frequencies, but not at the intervening frequencies. Therefore NPL's current VNA capability requires extending into the WR6 D-Band.

The most effective way to achieve this is for NPL to acquire a pair of WR6 D-Band VNA Extender Heads.

Significant societal change is required in order to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the UK by 2050. For example, the CCC estimate that the majority (62%) of emission reductions will require some form of behaviour change . The key to achieving a net zero society will be a move away from thinking about discreet low-carbon behaviours but rather thinking about system-wide approaches and how multifaceted social shifts can be embedded into everyday life .
To date, much analytical focus of net zero has centred upon technical and economic analysis. There is a clear need to add to this with a comprehensive piece of work focusing on the societal dimensions of net zero. This includes understanding the implications of net zero for people, the importance of societal change in reaching net zero and how we best facilitate relevant societal change. Whilst being procured by BEIS, this project is being carried in conjunction with a number of government departments and is anticipated to be project managed by Defra and BEIS.
The specific objectives this commission is looking to address are:
•	Objective 1: Holistically setting out the possible implications of net zero for people.
•	Objective 2: Identifying and assessing how different levels of societal change/responsiveness can affect the feasibility and costs/benefits of transitioning to net zero.
•	Objective 3: Identifying how, and where, cross-cutting interventions could be implemented to support the societal change necessary for net zero.
There are many ways the objectives and research questions within the work packages of this project could be met, and so we will strongly encourage innovative thinking from bidders as to how best to deliver this work.",,,"United Kingdom","72316000 79311300 79315000 ","Ben Walker & Danielle Emerson",behavioural.insights@defra.gov.uk,"1 Victoria Street",,London,SW1H0ET,England,"020 7215 5613",,"BEIS ITT Pack Contracts Finder - For Publication.docx DPF31 Terms and Conditions for Services June 2018.doc NZ_Society_Pre_engagement_Event.pptx Early Supplier Event_Net Zero Societal Change Research & Analysis Q&As.docx Attendee List for Circulation_Revised Version.docx UPDATED - BEIS ITT Pack Contracts Finder - For Publication - revised dates.docx Net Zero Societal Change Clairification Q&A.docx Updated Clairification Q&A inc updated timings 11.06.20.docx Amended BEIS ITT Pack Contracts Finder 15.06.20.docx Updated Clairification Q&A 15.06.20.docx ",,,06/07/2020,31/03/2021,22/06/2020,YES,2392/05/2020,Yes,Yes,No,Services,100000,120000,02/07/2020,115240,"[ENERGY SYSTEMS CATAPULT SERVICES LIMITED|18 The Priory Queensway

was made to close the Satellite Testing Service at Fieldhead Hospital, Wakefield on 5th July 2020 despite a

have this testing in place would create a serious and imminent threat to public health.

Given the urgency, tt was impossible to comply with the usual timescales in the PCRs - even with reduced time

Winter service activities are costly, but efficiencies can be gained with accurate and timely weather information. If ice, frost or snow is predicted salting will take place on about 30% of the maintainable network (approximately 2,500Km). More roads will be treated if severe winter weather is expected.

The Winter Service Weather Forecasting Contract is for a daily weather forecasting service during the winter service forecast periods, comprising text and graphical forecasts issued to Vaisala Ltd, together with access to this data via the internet directly to the Provider's web site. All data to be available 24 hours a day during the winter service periods. Additionally, electronic information is to be compatible to enable the use of appropriate web-based applications used by the County Council as part of its mobile and out of hours working arrangements. 

The weather forecasting service will be tailored to meet the needs of HT&W over seven climatic domains, plus an additional domain for Medway Council, these domains are shown in the ITT. Each domain has at least one dedicated weather station forecast site provided and maintained by Vaisala Ltd. The Consultant will also have access to other weather stations in Kent owned and maintained by Highways England. These and the other Kent weather stations are shown in the ITT 

HT&W are currently conducting a trial of 120 road surface temperature sensors and will be using this information to assist in redefining its domains. The new domains may be operational by the start of this contract and the Council reserves the right to include these in the contract.

Health Education England (HEE - the Commissioner) are putting out this notice as a PIN (Prior Information Notice) with a view to completing a Direct Award. 


Please note the contracting authority intends to direct award the contracts to City University and Kingston University/St. Georges University of London for a short period of time while it determines the authority's commissioning intentions. The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal. 


HEE believe that these universities have the proven academic and technical expertise to support these programmes in 2020/21. To our knowledge they are the only providers of these programmes in London. To test the market HEE had intended to undertake a formal procurement process for these programmes in April 2020 but due to the current national Covid-19 situation this was not appropriate or permissible. 


 


It is envisaged that while the current specifications are underway in 2020/21, an open procurement process will be undertaken for work to be started in 2021 onwards (2-3 years). 


 


The contract period will be a maximum value of £300,000.   


 


For the Specification, Contract and the Case for Direct Award please access the portal at:                                https://procontract.due-north.com/Opportunities/Index?p=40bb618e-0a24-e611-8114-000c29c9ba21&v=2 


Project title: Non- Medical Integrated Clinical Academic Careers - Health Education England 


Please access the portal for all documents.   


All communications should be made via the messaging function on the ProContract E-Tendering portal.   


If any provider has concerns with the commissioning intentions outlined within the published documentation, please raise this via the ProContract eTendering Portal in the first instance within 30 days of the date of this Prior Information Notice. 


The closing date of this PIN is midnight on the 8th July 2020.

Broughton parish council are seeking tenders for the renovation and extension to the Toll Bar Cottage, a heritage property in the centre of the Village. The agreed plans for this former domestic property include the renovation for the 17th Century cottage and the erection of an extension to facilitate future use as a café and community meeting rooms. The full specification has been prepared by an architect, structural engineer and other relevant professionals.
The work will commence in August/September 2020 with a view to completion for the Christmas tree lights switch on in early December.
Funding is secured for this work (see additional information). The Parish Council may accept part works tenders if the whole project can be covered this way but the Parish council expect the agreed contractor(s) will appoint a contracts manager to oversee the work and liaise with the parish council and Preston City Council Building Inspectorate.
The work is commissioned by Broughton Parish Council who purchased this property in September 2019 from Pillars Construction who are developing the site to the East of the Cottage. Once the entry road is completed they will gift back a strip of land to the south end of the garden.
The Parish Council have set up a committee to manage, oversee and progress this work consisting of 3/4 councillors who will report back to the 6 weekly Parish Council meetings. They will be available to assist the contractor(s) as required. 
The project requires renovation to the Cottage that was built in 1745, extended in 1841(2 Toll bar Cottages) and had additional work which included the insertion of gables to the 1st floor front & porch in the 1910 and finally the erection of a garage & removal of internal walls in the 1940's). Whilst the Parish Council is aware that extensive work is required to bring the property up to public use standards they wish to retain as many features of the historic building as possible.

The Toll Bar Cottage Committee are willing to discuss with the contractor(s) areas where the work could be simplified or would significantly reduce costs as long as these do not require the plans to be altered in such a way as the design would require submission back to planning and could be agreed with the building inspector.

The Interim Director of Operational Excellence will lead our work to build capability of providers in sustainably serving people in vulnerable circumstances, and work across the organisation to lead on delivering appropriate financial support to enable sustainable scaling of affordable finance providers.

We are seeking a secondee who has a track record of being able to step into situations to deliver effectively as part of a team to lead establishment of this area and delivery of priorities, including coordination and supervision of a number of secondees and consultants working on key projects over the next few months.
We will be seeking to appoint a permanent member of the team in due course, however the delivery programme we have set over the next months in accelerating our work means we need an interim to ensure we can deliver on our commitments over that period.

This is envisaged as a full-time secondment to start mid-July. 

Fair4All Finance has been founded to increase the financial wellbeing of the most vulnerable groups in society by increasing access to fair, affordable and appropriate financial products and services. Through increasing access to and the use of fair financial products and services we will help people in vulnerable circumstances to meet their day to day financial needs, absorb shocks and smooth incomes.

The Affordable Credit Programme follows a pilot programme which Fair4All Finance led between August 2019 and February 2020. This programme took five organisations through a due diligence and detailed business diagnostic process to determine the most appropriate support that Fair4All Finance could put into that organisation.

During this programme a previous secondee managed a multi-functional due diligence team to lead these detailed assessments, resulting in a due diligence report for each organisation which was presented to their boards and to the board of Fair4All Finance along with investment recommendations.",,e16ls,,"79411000 ","Becky Claydon",becky@fair4allfinance.org.uk,"2nd Floor 28 Commercial Street",,London,E16LS,England,07940519544,,,,,13/07/2020,30/09/2020,03/07/2020,YES,"RFQ 001",Yes,No,No,Services,40000,87000,09/07/2020,70000,"[GRANT THORNTON|GRANT THORNTON HO

The programme offers free technical support and grant funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to businesses, public-sector and community organisations in Dorset.  And aims to help Dorset based organisations to improve energy efficiency, increase the use of renewable energy, and aid the development of new low carbon products in Dorset.
The programme is led by Dorset Council (DC) and the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
The programme launched in April 2018 and is now in its final year of delivery.  Dorset Council recently submitted a bid for a further £4.26m of ERDF funding, which, if successful will extend the programme by a further three years and will bring its total value up to £14.9m.  The Council will be notified on whether it has been successful in securing the additional funds in July 2020.
As part of the contractual requirements of ERDF funding, Low Carbon Dorset is required to procure a supplier to conduct an impact evaluation of the programme, known as a ""Summative Assessment"".  We wish to identify a suitably experienced organisation to undertake this summative assessment for the existing 3-year programme, and, providing the additional funding is secured, the additional 2-year programme extension.
This specification sets out the key requirements for the summative assessment and its development.  The provider shall be required to work closely with the Council to undertake a programme evaluation and provide a final summative assessment report together with a summary in line with the requirements of the ERDF summative assessment guidance and further requirements noted within the tender Specification Schedule document and linked ERDF guidance.
