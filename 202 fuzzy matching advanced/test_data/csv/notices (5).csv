"Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) Second Contract Award",Contract,"Crown Commercial Service",Awarded,2020-08-27T08:37:56Z,"Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) Second Contract Award Notice","The 'Ventilator Challenge' was created by the UK government and delivered across several government departments (Department of Health and Social Care, Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence) as part of the drive to increase ventilator supply and support the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its response to the Coronavirus disease global pandemic (COVID-19).

In March, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad.
The 'Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) programme' is a work stream within the Ventilator Challenge progressing novel and modified designs for ventilator devices, manufactured on a rapid basis to ensure sufficient capacity within the NHS.

Cabinet Office, who are running the RMVS programme on behalf of the UK government, engaged with a wide range of suppliers, including designers, manufacturers and component suppliers, to progress a number of ventilator models (by taking forward existing designs through licencing agreements and by developing new products based on existing products and based on new original designs) resulting in the manufacturer of over 14,000 ventilators to meet the identified need.

A Contract Award Notice was published on 25/05/2020 (reference 2020/S 100-243206) covering contracts awarded pursuant to the RMVS programme. This is a second Contract Award Notice that covers contracts awarded thereafter. This notice also updates the expenditure incurred for contracts relating to Team Consulting, TTP and Cambridge Consultants that were notified in the previous Contract Award Notice. These contracts were awarded on a time and materials basis and therefore additional expenditure was incurred since publication of the previous notice.

For the Smiths Parapac 300, the original contract value was £34,007,542.00. The contract was awarded for 4,418 ventilators, however these volumes were not achieved in the time frames given, therefore the spend to date is £25,500,000.00 (ex. VAT).",,,"United Kingdom","33157000 ","Dan Webster",cco@cabinetoffice.gov.uk,"9th Floor, The Capital Building,","Old Hall Street",Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,"+44 08009981098",https://www.gov.uk/ccs,"Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a call for competition in accordance with Article 32 of Directive 201424EU.pdf ","https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:406004-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML ","Contract 1 - Agreement for the Manufacture and Supply of Ventilators (Smiths ParaPac 300)

At this stage of the process, Applicants are invited to express an interest in providing standard market research services to Ofcom in one or more of these lots. Applicants that pass this initial assessment will be invited to take part in the second stage of the tender.  If successful in the second stage of the tender, they will be added as Tenderers to the framework agreement for a particular Lot(s).

The Lots under this framework will be:
Lot 1 - Quantitative Research
Lot 2- Qualitative Research
Lot 3 - Face to Face omnibus research

The Scheme however remains at risk of not being able to recover funds from a supplier following a compliance investigation.",,,"United Kingdom","79940000 ","DCMS Commercial",commercial@culture.gov.uk,"100 Parliament Street",,London,SW1A2BQ,England,,,,,,12/03/2020,11/03/2025,11/03/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,500000,,12/03/2020,500000,"[INTEGRATED DEBT SERVICES LTD|8 Fletcher Gate

In March, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad.
The 'Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) programme' is a workstream within the Ventilator Challenge progressing novel and modified designs for ventilator devices, manufactured on a rapid basis to ensure sufficient capacity within the NHS.
Cabinet Office, who are running the RMVS programme on behalf of the UK government, engaged with a wide range of suppliers, including designers, manufacturers and component suppliers, to progress a number of ventilator models (by taking forward existing designs through licencing agreements and by developing new products based on existing products and based on new original designs) resulting in the manufacturer of ventilators to meet the identified need.",,,"United Kingdom","33157000 ","Dan Webster",cco@cabinetoffice.gov.uk,"9th Floor, The Capital Building, Old Hall Street",,Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,"+44 08009981098",https://www.gov.uk/ccs,"Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a call for competition in accordance with Article 32 of Directive 201424EU.pdf ","https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:243206-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML ","Contract 1 - Contract for the provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator System (RMVS) - (Design agreement for the Apollo 13 model)

Bidder can bid for one or more Lots :

Lot 1 - Croydon University Hospital A&E (Croydon Health Services NHS Trust)

Lot 3 - Newham University Hospital A&E (Barts Health Trust)
Lot 4 - The Whittington A&E (Whittington Health NHS Trust)

There is a brief description of each of the five A&E Departments within the specification. It is important to note that all the A&Es serve a population wider than the borough within which they are located. There is therefore an expectation that the Service supports young people attending the A&E regardless of where they live.

The Service is aimed at vulnerable 12 to 25 year-olds who attend the adult or paediatric A&E departments or Urgent Care Centres at the five hospitals listed above. The Service must work alongside the team in the A&E to proactively identify vulnerable young people and help them to access and engage the support they need to prevent any potential escalation of violence and reduce the risk of repeat victimisation or exploitation.

The national programme is being tested with female offenders resident in six boroughs in South West London, and will be based out of the Beth Centre in Lambeth. The intended overarching impact of the programme is to ensure that eligible resident women receive the most appropriate sentence for their individual needs.

As well as providing assessments and primary mental healthcare for MHTRs, there will be a requirement for significant partnership working with probation and substance misuse services, to sequence and support combined orders.

1.	Outline Business Case Production

Barts Health requires the production of an OBC document, to be compliant with all relevant guidance including but not limited to: 

•	HM Treasury Green Book (2018)
•	Capital Investment Manual Business Case Guide (NHS Executive, 1994) 
•	Capital Regime, Investment and Property Business Case Approval Guidance for NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts (NHS Improvement, 2016)
•	The Guide to Developing the Project Business Case - Better Business Case for better outcomes (HM Treasury, 2018)

•	Take responsibility for the co-ordination and production of the full OBC, utilising existing content from the SOC and other supporting documents. The exception to this is the finance case which the Trust finance team will lead. The OBC author will link in with the Trust finance team to ensure consistency between cases and good co-ordination of the final OBC
•	Ensure consistent narrative and assumptions throughout the OBC document from all contributors
•	Maintain good version control, keeping an audit trail of all key decisions, changes and assumptions
•	Provide regular progress reports, flagging any key issues or risks, with a pragmatic way forward
•	Complete the NHSI business case checklist (and any other checklists required by regulators) and support dialogue with regulators and managing OBC queries
•	Work as part of the Whipps Cross PMO to ensure the programme plan reflects key milestones required to meet the OBC deadline, and hold workstream leads accountable for meeting those milestones
•	Work with all partners and stakeholders as required to obtain information and develop the narrative of the document

For clarity, the OBC author will be responsible for co-ordinating and updating the Comprehensive Investment Appraisal Model (CIAM) produced during the SOC stage with the latest OBC information. This will include producing an update of the quantified benefits.

Women initially undergo two-view mammography of each breast. The resulting images are reported by two independent readers who may be breast radiologists, breast physicians, consultant radiographers or advanced practitioner radiographers. The two possible outcomes from image reporting are abnormal or normal.

The aim of the Programme is to maximise screening sensitivity (diagnosing the disease in the population who have the disease) whilst also maximising screening specificity (correctly identifying those who do not have the disease).

PHE originally went out to market using the open procedure with only one tenderer (the existing supplier) expressing an interest. Subsequently that tenderer notified PHE that they could no longer fulfil the requirements of the specification due to a key member of staff moving to the University of Nottingham. The tenderer subsequently transferred the intellectual property to the University of Nottingham to help facilitate the continuance of programme monitoring.

The University of Nottingham have agreed to meet the specification requirements at the same cost as the bidder that originally tendered therefore ensuring value for money.

As there is only one supplier capable of meeting the requirements PHE used the negotiated procedure without prior publication to award the contract to the University of Nottingham under Regulations 32 (2) (b) (ii) and (iii).",,,"Any region","72000000 85000000 ",,tenders@phe.gov.uk,"Manor Farm Road, Porton Down",,Salisbury,"SP4 0JG",England,"01980 619960",,,,,02/03/2020,01/03/2021,17/09/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,300000,,02/03/2020,249071,"[The University of Nottingham|University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,02/03/2020,01/03/2021,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",

The Council wants to work with a Development Partner/Service Provider ('the Development Partner') to deliver the following three service elements, described more fully in the Service Specification, that make up this Technology Enabled Care Service ('TEC Service' or 'the Service'): 
      
      o Service Element 1 - Innovation and development of technology and/or digital services for West Sussex residents that complement their own support and networks (using their own financial resources where this is appropriate). The Development Partner will include flexibility for new projects and technology which may arise throughout the life of the Contract;
      
      o Service Element 2 - 'Technology First' cultural change including a TEC Learning and Development programme; and 
      
      o Service Element 3 - supply, set up and monitoring of TEC, continuously improving and extending the range and use of technological and digital services and products to meet individually identified health and social care outcomes.
       
      A 'Competitive Procedure with Negotiation' procurement process will be undertaken. This will lead to a one or two stage approach dependent upon the initial tender responses received. This will allow for a slightly more flexible approach if potential re-submissions are required from bidders.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Council reserves the right to proceed to award a contract on the basis of initial tenders without negotiation.

In 2016 we launched our Simply Better strategy which outlines our aspirations for the future and describes our four core values; collegiality, sustainability, internationalisation and quality. Substantial work has taken place since then to create the foundations for our strategy and we are now in a position to increase the focus on the development of our line managers to ensure they are supported to be the best they can be and deliver our strategy.   

We have over 6000 staff members, of which 1350 have line management responsibility across the academic and professional service community. The Leadership and Management Development Team (LMDT) was formed in 2016 to provide training to all line managers, the team is made up of 8 staff members; the Head of Leadership and Management Development, 4 training facilitators and 3 administrative support staff. 

The Leadership and Management Development Framework (LMDF) was introduced to outline the skills required to develop high performing leaders and managers. A number of blended learning interventions from the framework have been developed, which have focused on building line manager competence in two key areas, performance management and change.

Within the line manager population many have had no formal line management development and some do not even recognise the responsibilities they hold with this role, resulting in different levels of competence and confidence. To provide additional clarity regarding the specific responsibilities of line managers we have introduced five Line Manager Expectations; Managing People, Managing the Student and Customer Experience, Managing Financial Decisions, Managing Risk and Managing Compliance.
 
We now plan to introduce, a comprehensive line-management development programme aligned to the LMDF and our strategic goals. The Leading for the Future Programme will develop line manager competence and confidence in delivering all five of the line manager expectations and will enable them to develop a consistent approach to line management.",,,"South East","80511000 80521000 80532000 80570000 ","Alex Oakley",A.G.Oakley@soton.ac.uk,"University Road",,SOUTHAMPTON,SO171BJ,England,,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofsouthampton/aspx/Tenders/Current,,,"Tender Portal

Through this programme we will determine how CQC can best be organised to more efficiently and effectively deliver the strategy. It will provide a vital link between strategy and the operation and will form the foundation for successful transformational change moving forwards.  
 
The CQC target operating model will articulate what the organisation will look like in the future, defining everything from the business processes, technology and physical estate we will need to the cultural and leadership behaviors we will require. Essentially it will depict 'what we do and how we do it, who we are and how we behave'. 

We require the support of consultancy services to undertake this exercise as we do not have the expert in-house capability to undertake such a task within the necessary timescales. The programme will however, be headed up by experienced Programme Director who is familiar with executing such initiatives, and a small internal team. It is our intention to build our internal capacity over the 6-month duration so that we are able to own and drive the implementation of the TOM beyond its approval.

      Vicarage field is located in the north east of Hailsham town centre, and currently includes within it; Vicarage Field Shopping Centre, Hailsham Parish Church, Wealden District Council Offices, the Freedom Leisure Centre, The Charles Hunt Centre, and the Hailsham Club, as well as areas of the High Street. The site provides an opportunity for Hailsham to experience an overall improved 'town centre experience' by providing permeability to the town. The project also aims to reduce leakage of the local population away from Hailsham by creating a more attractive and accessible town centre, that retains its local shoppers.

The equipment should have adequate robustness, high precision and repeatability to facilitate the manufacture of high performance aerospace, automotive and similar parts with demanding tolerance requirements.  As the equipment will be utilised for research projects rather than production, its usage will be subject to frequent change to suit different projects.  The solution should therefore be readily and rapidly changeable to work in new modes of operation.

Compulsory requirements: 
 
1.	Must have the ability to machine a range of aerospace, automotive and other high value manufacturing industries; including titanium, nickel superalloys, steel and stainless steel.
2.	Machine including ancillaries must not exceed 3000mm (length) x 3000mm (width) and 3000mm (height) see attached Diagram 1 for more detail. 
3.	Must weigh a maximum 10,000Kg or less.
4.	Must have a tool magazine with a capacity of at least 25 tools.
5.	Must include Sprint Probe.

The aim of the scheme is to provide access to NHS standards of medical and dental care, as far as practicable, for staff and qualifying dependants posted overseas. Where this is not practicable, the risks must be understood by the Contractor and made clear to the Authority and Users.

The service requirement is complex and challenging. The Contractor will be required to provide access to medical and dental care worldwide in all types of environments. The Contractor must also be able to refer cases back into the NHS system or the Defence Medical Services (DMS) when required. The user populations are varied and include many foreign-born staff members and partners who may not have automatic entitlement to the NHS; this will provide a challenge for the Contractor to look at innovative solutions to the provision of care for this group.

Central management of the contract will be in London, United Kingdom. Service delivery is required globally",,,London,"85100000 ","FCO Commercial Directorate",cpg.enquiries@fco.gov.uk,"Room K.2.10, King Charles Street",,London,"SW1A 2AH",England,,,,,"

On completion of the CT event, this data is to be presented to the Authority for storage and future use.
      TESIK must have the capability to integrate with the Synthetic Wrap capability provided by Project SCOPIC / SCOPIC2 (simulated ISTAR feed). There must be scope to integrate additional instrumented capabilities should they be developed and delivered during the life of the contract.

Lot 2 is aimed at firms with specialist actuarial capabilities who will have experience in either the pensions or insurance industries.

The DfE offsite framework is being established to cultivate innovation and modernise the industry by increasing the adoption of MMC (modern methods of construction) offsite production in the market, in line with the government's commitment to MMC and its presumption in favour of offsite construction by 2019 across suitable capital programmes, where it represents best value for money.
The DfE has appointed 5 contractors to each Lot. 
Lot 1 is intended for the delivery of offsite built Secondary Schools and Secondary blocks of Gross Internal Area (GIA) 6,000 m2 and above throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 1 to deliver batches of primary school schemes. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 2 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 1 is expected to be a throughput of 15 secondary schemes per year. DFE makes no guarantee to any Bidder or contractor that they will be awarded any schemes and no guarantee is made in respect of any volume of work under the Framework Agreement.
Lot 2 is intended for the delivery of offsite built primary school schemes and secondary blocks of GIA from 750 to 6,000+ m2 throughout England, but the DfE may use Lot 2 to deliver secondary school schemes above 6,000 m2. Schemes awarded under the framework will be subject to a mini competition or allocated via a performance based allocation procedure. The stated Lot value of 1 000 000 000 GBP is the maximum headroom for schemes delivered under this lot but the actual value of schemes is anticipated to be lower than this figure. The median anticipated pipeline for Lot 2 is expected to be a throughput of 15 primary schemes per year,.

Promoting the programme and managing applications:
•	Design and deliver appropriate marketing strategies in partnership with sector specialist networks 
•	Advise on the best approach to managing demand and attracting high quality applications 
•	Manage the end to end customer journey for applicants and grantees, setting clear expectations about timescales for decisions and feedback and the work involved. 
•	Design and provide a simple and proportionate online application process for each grant product with support from Access's learning partner 

Decision making: 
•	Develop and operate a proportionate and robust decision making process for each grant product 
•	For unsuccessful applicants, provide feedback on how their application can be improved and /or signpost to other relevant sources of support.

Awarding and managing grants: 
•	Undertake appropriate due diligence checks to ensure appropriate use of public money, and provide relevant grant documentation for the charity to sign, establishing necessary milestones and with clear reporting requirements. 
•	Manage payment processes of grants in trances as appropriate to grantees. 
•	Gather monitoring information and data from grantees to ensure compliance with grant terms and conditions
•	Make data and information about the performance of the grant programme available to be published. 
•	Ensure adherence to all relevant laws, regulations (including State Aid), requirements upon Access and best practice for grant making.

•	Establishing regular reviews with the user/carer according to their individual needs.

It has been established to respond flexibly to young people's priorities and needs, and will deliver a range of programmes and projects that aim to improve young people's outcomes. This ""Pseudo"" Open Framework commenced on the 1st September 2019, for a period of 4 years, consisting of 17 suitably qualified organisations.

The ""Pseudo"" Open Framework Agreement has been commissioned under the Light Touch Regime (implemented through regulations 74-77 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015). This Framework Agreement differs from those let under the non-light touch regime in that the Council may exercise its flexibility to periodically 'open' the framework for organisations to submit applications to join, particularly if it needs to increase capacity or to respond to emerging needs. 

The Council has exercised its flexibility to 'open' the Framework for organisations to submit applications to join the Framework for the remainder of its term (until 31st August 2023) and is now appointing another 21 suitably qualified organisations to the Framework.

The anticipated value of the Framework over its full term (from 1st September 2019) is £2,000,000. To date, two contracts have been called off the Framework with the following values:

1. London Youth Games. Initial contract value = £110,130. There is also the option to extend this contract for a period, or periods, of up to a further 2 years for up to a value of £65,692 per annum (Potential maximum total contract value = £241,514).

At present there is not enough impartial information widely available to give the industry the confidence to widely increase the uptake of MMC. To remedy this Homes England is encouraging developers to commit to advanced levels of MMC on eight sites totalling almost 1,500 homes. As a condition of the development of this land we are mandating that the sites will have to be subject to research and performance monitoring to understand the benefits (and the potential draw backs) of delivering housing using different types of MMC technology.   
This study will provide a body of research which can answer the questions frequently asked by housebuilders, contractors, commissioners, financers, insurers, etc... as regards issues such as cost of delivery, the energy performance of MMC homes, the prevalence of delivery defects, material wastage levels, etc... by monitoring the projects from foundations through to one-year post occupancy.  
This data and analysis needs to be in a format that can be readily shared with industry, local & national government and other interested parties to provide clear evidence on how MMC performs against traditional build.  It is intended that this landmark study provides a template for how the industry and other partners can measure the performance of MMC in the future, creating a substantial body of data and encouraging the uptake of MMC more widely.

This will involve measurement of total carbon-14 release into the gas and aqueous phases during leaching in an appropriate solution, together with characterisation of the composition. Specifically, this study would investigate the release of carbon-14 from Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) graphite and compare to the previous results obtained from WAGR, BEP0 and Magnox graphite. This will require an experimental programme that closely follows the methods and test durations previously studied for Magnox graphite to provide comparable results. RWM request that the contractor propose a baseline schedule based on a total leaching duration of 24 months, with appropriate scheduled sampling intervals. RWM also request that schedules based on 36 and 48 month leaching durations are also included as optional tasks/extensions, that would allow the leaching to be extended if the results towards the end of 24 months warrant further experimental studies.",,,"Any region","73000000 73100000 73110000 73111000 73200000 73300000 ","Anthony E  Potts",tony.potts@nda.gov.uk,"Building 329, Thomson Avenue",,Didcot,OX110RH,ENG,"+44 1925802897",https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/shared-services-alliance-ssa-for-nuclear-decommissioning-estate,,"https://sharedsystems.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=12026&B=SELLAFIELD https://sharedsystems.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/3510 ",,21/01/2020,31/12/2024,15/10/2019,NO,,No,No,No,Services,445265,576520,27/01/2020,445265,"[Wood Nuclear Limited|Booths Park

      The University of Reading and its associated Trusts and subsidiaries (the ""University Group""), will appoint the Bidder who can manage the £120m+ of endowment portfolios as currently constituted, but with the capacity and expertise to expand the remit if required to include other classes of asset (such as private equity and infrastructure assets).  
      
      This tender is for Investment Manager only, but the University is also interested in certain additional services.  This is investment advice on a wider portfolio of assets.  To this end, a second optional section and series of questions has been included.
      This section is not compulsory, but should prospective managers answer these questions they will carry an overall weighting of 10% in the final scoring.  This is the additional value that the University places on these investment advisor services.

Crown Agents Limited as the leader of the consortium managing the HPF, invites bidders (Consultants) for the implementation of a household health survey to provide data for a baseline and tracking of six (6) key health indicators as described in Table 1 of the Terms of Reference,  using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) method in eight (8) of the ten (10) former states of the Republic of South Sudan.

It is anticipated that the outputs from this research will underpin UK proposals for test procedures to be included in the relevant standards and/or regulations.
DGD leads on the policy for the safe and secure carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail and has oversight of the sea and air modes. Goods that are classified as hazardous are vital to our economy and a modern way of life, and can include chemicals for industry, fuel for transport and to heat and light our homes, or batteries which power our electric devices.  Movement of such goods is essential, but it must be carried out in a way which minimises the risk of harm to people, property or the environment. 
The Division's objective is therefore to ensure that the regulations continue to safeguard the carriage of dangerous goods, but in a manner that is proportionate and does not needlessly hinder trade. The division also exists to ensure that the UK compliance and enforcement framework is as effective as possible.
The DGD research programme derives from recent experience with non-compliant petrol tankers which could have led to the failure of some fuel deliveries. The programme supports implementation of lessons learned and further proportionate improvements to the design, construction, testing and inspection of tankers, so as to reduce the risk of non-compliance and avoid further issues. It will also support the UK negotiating position at international standards fora, minimising the risk of disproportionate regulations and backing the UK interest.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,SPATS_Framework_Lot1@highwaysengland.co.uk,"The Cube",,Birmingham,"B1 1RN",England,,,"1-968 DFT AWARD LETTER - LOT 1 TRANS.docx ",,,02/01/2020,03/09/2021,02/12/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,799997,,02/01/2020,799997.59,[TRL|Wokingham|NONE||No|No],,02/01/2020,03/09/2021,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",
