    "**Python** is the programming language, it is **intepreted** as opposed to **compiled** (as in the C language). You could write the code in python in a plain text file with Notepad, save it ending in .py and the Python intepreter would just run it straight away.  \n",

    "People develop **libraries** to add features, using Python or C language for speed. Modules and packages are also ways of bulding extra reausable functionality. Libraries can be fairly small, like a library that offer functions to calculate the Levinshtein distance between too text for fuzzy matching. Or, they can be massive, like pandas or Scikit-Learn which bring their own syntax and framework for developing with them and you need to learn them like if they were specialised products.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are published in publicly available **repositories** or **channels** and you can install them using commands like pip or **conda**, if you have Anaconda. Libraries often build on (have **dependencies** on) each other and it is important to consider when upgrading and installing them.  \n",

    "One of these libraries is **JupyterLab** which is expand python with a web GUI offering an interactive way to code and run python in small chunks or **cells** in any order, as part of a **notebook**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebooks** are what you are seeing now, which mix text and code and the result of the code, kind of a webpage with interactive bits. Notebooks, under the bonnet are still text files ending with .ipynb but you can't really work on them directly.  \n",
    "You can edit those notebooks using the native **JupyterLab** interface using a web browser. \n",
    "Or, you can use **VSCode**, a popular coding tool from Microsoft which supports both notebooks and .py files. **Spyder** is another popular coding tool.\n",
